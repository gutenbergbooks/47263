<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;I have the honor to transmit herewith the manuscript
of the fifth in our series of fruit-publications, to be known as
"The Peaches of New York," and to constitute Part II of the report
of this institution for 1916.</p>

<p>Peach-growing is an important industry in the State of New York.
In certain counties the production of this fruit has been a main factor in
the well-known prosperity of many owners of peach-orchards. Moreover,
the peach, when at its best, is a luscious article of food and adds
greatly not only to the enjoyment, but to the healthfulness, of our diet.</p>

<p>The commercial and dietary importance of the peach is, therefore,
the justification for the preparation of this volume.</p>

<p>Because the numerous varieties of peaches differ greatly in quality
and in their adaptation to varying conditions, a comprehensive study of
those varieties which are, or which may be, grown in this State seemed
greatly worth while.</p>

<p>It is with a feeling of satisfaction, even of pride, that I submit
to you the accompanying manuscript.  Its preparation reflects great
credit upon Prof. Hedrick and his associates and upon the makers of
the plates.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The present volume is the fifth in the plan of the New York Agricultural
Experiment Station to make a more or less complete record of all
of the different fruits grown in this region. This work differs from the
preceding fruit-books but little or not at all in nature and purposes, yet a
statement of its contents, even though it be almost identical with that in
the prefaces of the preceding volumes, is necessary for those who may not
have the other books and may be a convenience to those who have all of
the series.</p>

<p>The title implies that <i>The Peaches of New York</i> is written for the confines
of a state; but all varieties of the peach grown in North America, as
well as many known only in other continents, Europe especially, have been
considered, under the supposition that all might be grown in New York and
are therefore of interest to the peach-growers of the State. Broadly speaking,
then, the design is to make the book as complete a record as possible
of the development of the peach, wherever grown, up to this time.</p>

<p>The book contains: An account of the history and uses of the peach;
a discussion of the botanical characters of the species of cultivated peaches;
an account of the peach-regions and of peach-growing in New York with
the most important statistics relating to this fruit; and, lastly and in
greatest detail, the synonymy, bibliography, economic status, and full
descriptions of all the most important cultivated peaches, with briefer
notices of varieties of minor importance and of those appearing in peach-literature
which are now no longer grown. In foot-notes running through
the text, biographical sketches are published of the persons who have done
most in America toward improving the peach. Incidentally, all that was
thought would be helpful in breeding peaches was included. So, too,
whatever appeared to be of interest to students of ecology has been given
a place.</p>

<p>As in the preceding books, color-plates occupy prominent places in
this volume. Pains and expense have not been spared in the attempt to
make the plates the best possible with the present knowledge of reproduction
in colors. All who have seen the plates in this and the first four
fruit-books of the series will agree that the reproductions of peaches are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
more accurate than those of the apples, grapes, plums or cherries, and yet
these are not as exact as might be wished. Although most carefully
selected, an illustration of one or two fruits does not give an adequate picture
of a variety. Neither does the camera take colors quite as the eye sees
them nor can the plate-maker quite reproduce what the camera takes.
The illustrations are of life-size as the peaches grow on the grounds of this
Station and represent specimens of average size and color. The fruits,
as shown in the plates, look small for the reason that a flat picture of a round
object minifies size.</p>

<p>In all of these fruit-books it has been difficult to decide what varieties
merit color-plates and full descriptions. Briefly, the choice of sorts to be
illustrated and described in detail has been determined by the following
considerations: (1) By the value of the variety for home or commercial
orchards; (2) the probable value if the peach is a new sort on probation;
(3) its desirability as a parent in breeding new peaches or to show combinations
of varieties, to illustrate new characters, or to show the range in variation&mdash;in
a word to enlighten the peach-breeder; (4) not a few varieties
are described and illustrated to show the trend of peach-evolution&mdash;for
their historical value; (5) to show relationships of varieties.</p>

<p>The peach is profoundly influenced by soil, climate and culture, and a
discussion of its status is not complete without taking full account of the
environment in which it is growing. For this reason, chiefly, the peach-regions
and peach-growing in New York are discussed as fully as space
permits. This part of the book is designed, also, to serve the prospective
peach-planter in this State in the selection of locations and soils and in the
culture of the peach. Since the cultivation of any plant changes from year
to year, though, experiment station bulletins and circulars and treatises
on the culture of the peach should supply growers of this fruit with better
information on the year-to-year management of the peach-plantation.</p>

<p>The botany of the peach, as compared with its congeners, the plum and
the cherry, is simple, indeed, and is well agreed upon by botanical writers,
so that this book may be said to be almost wholly a horticultural one.
Yet the few pages devoted to the botany of the peach may make plainer,
to the horticulturist at least, the botany of this fruit.</p>

<p>The chief contribution <i>The Peaches of New York</i> makes to pomology
is in the descriptions of varieties it contains. All who grow or use peaches
are dependent on descriptions of fruit and tree for the identification of
varieties. From a well-written description one should get an exact mental
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
picture of the fruit&mdash;we try to present such a pen-picture. With a few
exceptions the descriptions of major varieties have been made from peaches
growing on the Station grounds, though in many cases fruits from several
localities have been compared with those grown at home.</p>

<p>The fruits, it must be said at once, have been described with other
ends in view than identification. Chief of these is the effort to set forth
the elementary characters, or unit-characters, of the peach. It is now certain
that the characters of plants are independent entities thrown into
various relationships with each other in individual plants. On this conception
of unit-characters the improvement of plants is founded. An
important part of the work in describing fruits has been to discover what
seem to be unit-characters in peaches, thereby aiding in building a foundation
in breeding peaches. To improve the peach we must combine the
characters of species and varieties; we must know what these are before we
can rearrange them in an improved peach.</p>

<p>In the marked attention paid to the improvement of plants, following
the work of Mendel and others, the peach is bound to receive consideration.
Never was information more needed in regard to the processes that have
brought peaches from their primitive condition to their present perfection.
We have done our utmost to give all that could be learned of the origin and
history of varieties with the hope that such knowledge may be helpful to
those who are trying to improve the peach.</p>

<p>We wish again to call attention to the great value of definite knowledge
regarding the soils, climates and other environmental conditions under
which species and varieties of fruits thrive. It is obvious to all thinking
pomologists and biologists that, when the ecological conditions under
which the several fruits and their many varieties are grown can be
accurately specified, valuable generalizations can be made regarding life-zones
and plant-distribution. In <i>The Peaches of New York</i>, as in the
preceding books, we state as accurately as possible the regions in which
and the conditions under which, species and varieties of the peach are
successfully grown.</p>

<p>So few species have been considered in <i>The Peaches of New York</i> that
we have had no need to refer to codes of botanical nomenclature. In the
use of horticultural names, lacking a better code, we have kept before us
the revised rules of the American Pomological Society though in many
cases we have not seen fit to follow these rules as the changes required by
their strict observance would augment rather than diminish confusion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span></p>

<p>The references given are those that have been used in ascertaining the
history and the economic status or in verifying the description of the
variety that follows. All of the synonyms created by pomologists to whose
works we have had access have been noted but in no case have we published
synonyms quoted by other writers. The work of reading references
and seeking out synonyms is a tremendous one, involving nearly three
years' work for several persons. We hope that this work sets straight in
high degree the great confusion in the names of peaches, but that we, no
matter how painstaking, could bring perfection out of chaos, no one could
expect.</p>

<p>Again we call attention to the biographical sketches found in the
foot-notes. Some men in every profession surpass their fellows in true
greatness. Such men there are in pomology, and a knowledge of their
career is indispensable to a full comprehension of the industry of growing
fruit. In the conquest of America we have honored, so far, only the men
who have expressed their energy in conquering the mines, the forests, the
fisheries and to a small degree those who have developed the soils; we have
shamefully neglected the great men who have developed our native fruits
and vegetables and adapted to the conditions of the New World the agricultural
products of the Old World. The brief biographical sketches in
these fruit-books are written in an effort to give in some measure the credit
and honor due to those who have improved fruits.</p>

<p>In the preparation of <i>The Peaches of New York</i>, besides those whose
names appear on the title page, I am indebted to R. D. Anthony, for
reading proof; to the Station editor, F. H. Hall, for his assistance; to the
Zeese-Wilkinson Company, New York City, for the beautiful color-plates
of peaches; and to the J. B. Lyon Company, Albany, New York, for good
workmanship in printing the book.</p>

<small>HISTORY OF THE PEACH</small></h2>

<p>The history of the peach follows step by step the history of agriculture.
The beginning of agriculture, as depicted in the traditions and embellished
in the poetry of ancient peoples, was the creation of useful plants by some
Divinity. But, counting unwritten history and poetic fancy as naught
and coming to recorded facts&mdash;those of history as we now have it&mdash;the
beginning of agriculture is marked by two recorded events. The first
occurred 2700 years B. C. when Emperor Chenming, Ruler of China,
instituted ceremonies for the sowing of various vegetables and grains. The
second event was the building of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh by some
ruler who lorded it over Egypt between 2500 to 2000 years B. C. and who
ornamented his handiwork with drawings of figs.</p>

<p>Yet these early records in China and Egypt were not made at the
beginnings of agriculture in those countries. Plants were undoubtedly
cultivated centuries before it occurred to Emperor Chenming that rice,
wheat and other crops deserved ceremonial sowings. The pyramids of
Gizeh could only have been built by an organized, civilized people with
cultivated fields on which to levy toll for the dormant season and lean
years&mdash;pyramids could hardly be raised by a people forced to skim a
day-to-day existence from wild plants. "Art is long and time is fleeting"
in agriculture, and between the obscure beginnings of this ancient art,
when naked men following the chase began to vary a meat diet with fruits,
grains and roots plucked from the wild, and the regular cultivation of
useful plants, as implied by these old records from China and Egypt, there
are many steps and thousands and thousands of years.</p>

<p>If, then, the history of the peach begins with the history of agriculture,
and the beginnings of agriculture are lost in the obscurity of
antiquity, it is useless to speculate as to how long the peach has been cultivated.
The statements of the early historians as to the age of the domesticated
peach are so at variance that they serve only to confuse. Indeed,
were we to attempt to bring into agreement the diverse assertions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
historians we should never know even the place of origin of the peach;
for it is upon data from botany that we must depend most in determining
the habitat of our fruit. This subject we now come to discuss in detail.</p>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF THE PEACH</h3>

<p>Names frequently breed misunderstandings and in the case of the
peach a fine brood of mistakes as to the origin of the fruit has come from
the name. As all know, "peach" and most of its equivalents in the
countries of Europe are derived from "Persia" and this has given rise to
the supposition that the original habitat of the fruit is Persia. The ancient
authors who mention the peach, as Theophrastus, Columella and Pliny,
agree that the home of the peach was Persia and, even until our own time,
to be written in any of these worthies is proof conclusive. While negative
evidence counts for but little, the notion is so firmly fixed that some, at
least, of the races of peaches are Persian products that it seems best to
clear the way for positive evidence by first proving that the first home
of the peach was not Persia.</p>

<p>Persia is pictured as a land of fruits before agriculture had begun in
Greece and Rome. The quince and the pomegranate probably originated
here and, with the olive, grape, almond, and, to the north at least, the
cherry and plum, have been cultivated from three to four thousand years.</p>

<p>At very early times the quince, pomegranate, olive and grape were
introduced from Persia, according to De Candolle, still our best authority,
into Greece and Rome and even the cherry and plum, from countries to
the north if not from Persia, reached southern Europe long before the
peach. It seems certain, as De Candolle suggests,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> that if the peach had
been a native of Persia, had it existed there during all time, so beautiful
and so delectable a fruit would have been taken earlier into Asia Minor
and Greece. As gratifying to all the senses by which we judge fruits as
any other product of the orchard, as easily transported and propagated
as any&mdash;more so than most&mdash;it cannot be believed that the other fruits
named would have been given preference over the peach by conquerors or
travelers carrying Persian luxuries to westward countries.</p>

<p>Moreover, as De Candolle further points out, the several Hebrew and
Sanskrit peoples did not speak in sacred or vulgar writings of the peach
as they did many times of the olive, quince, grape and pomegranate. Yet
these peoples radiated from the valleys of the Euphrates and were at all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
times in close communication with Persia. Since, according to the authoritative
De Candolle, Xenophon, who retreated with the ten thousand
401 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, does not mention the peach, this fruit probably did not reach
Greece until Alexander's expedition and was first mentioned by Theophrastus
332 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> (if the fruit mentioned by Theophrastus is the peach)
and did not reach Rome until after the beginning of the Christian era.</p>

<p>The more one examines historical records the more evident it becomes
that Greek and Roman writers assumed that the habitat of the peach,
which they called the Persian apple, was Persia because it came thence
to their countries. Ancient historians very commonly and very confusingly
made the assumption that the region from which a plant product
came to their country was its first habitat.</p>

<p>The best means of establishing the origin of a plant is to discover in
what country it grows spontaneously. This would be a simple matter,
indeed, if one could be sure that a given plant found growing wild is not
an escape from cultivation. Here is the trouble in the case of the peach.
According to the botanists the tree is now growing wild in Persia, as it is
in nearby countries, and for that matter in other parts of the Old World
and in many places in the New World. The painstaking De Candolle,
who has carefully sifted the evidence of the leading botanists until his time
of writing, 1882, concludes that the peach has never been truly wild in
Persia. An examination of the works of botanists writing since De Candolle's
study of the subject does not show that any offers proof that the
peach was originally wild in Persia.</p>

<p>Without going into the matter further it seems safe to say that the
Greek and Roman writers were at fault in naming Persia as the home of the
peach. To summarize: its late distribution, as compared with that of other
Persian fruits argues against such an origin; philology, which usually
affords indications touching the habitat of a species, is against the Persian
theory of origin since neither Hebrew nor Sanskrit names the peach;
lastly, botany, the most direct means of discovering the geographic origin
of a plant, offers no positive evidence that Persia is the home of the peach.
The fallacy that the peach comes from Persia, written in nearly all horticultural
and botanical works for 2000 years, now being disposed of, we
may take up the claim of China that the peach is another of its great gifts
to the world.</p>

<p>A survey of the subject is convincing that the peach comes from
China. Necessarily, such a survey must be brief, yet it is important
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
that no doubt be left as to the origin of the peach, thus freeing pomological
literature from the train of misunderstandings following the current opinion
that part of our peaches, at least, come from Persia. The terms "Persian
peaches" and the "Persian race of peaches" are misleading and should
be discarded. Data from botany and history furnish the chief proofs
that the fruit of this discussion is of Chinese origin.</p>

<p>Botany and history are a hard team to drive but when the two do
travel together in determining the origin of a plant the matter, as a rule,
is settled. Does botany accord with history in placing the original peach
in China? Botanists and explorers from first to last agree that the peach
is, and long has been, wild in China but there is no agreement as to the
nature of its wildness. Some say it is indigenous and others that it may
be an escape from cultivation. The peach runs wild so quickly in countries
to which it is adapted that it is almost impossible to say, from the evidence
to be found, whether it is an original or only a naturalized inhabitant of
China. But it seems more nearly to approach a truly feral condition in
China than in any other country unless it be America and all know that
in the New World it is an introduced plant.</p>

<p>Of the botanists and explorers who report finding the peach wild in
China, Frank N. Meyer<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> of the United States Department of Agriculture
is most explicit. Meyer, in sending seeds of wild peaches from China,
accompanies them with the following remarks:</p>

<p>"40001. Wild peaches having larger fruits than the ordinary wild
ones, said to come from near Tze Wu, to the south of Sianfu, but some
also probably collected from trees in gardens which were raised from wild
seeds. When seen wild this peach generally assumes a low bush form of
spreading habit; when planted in gardens and attended to, it grows up into
a small tree, reaching a height of 12 to 20 feet, with a smooth trunk of dark
mahogany-brown color. The leaves are always much smaller and more
slender than in cultivated varieties, while their color is much darker green.
They seem to be somewhat less subject to various diseases than the cultivated
sorts and they are most prolific bearers, although the fruit is of very
little value on account of its smallness and lack of flavor. In gardens
around Sianfu this wild peach is utilized as a stock for improved varieties.
It is also grown as an ornamental; said to be literally covered in spring with
multitudes of shell-pink flowers."</p>

<p>"40002. Wild peaches, occurring in the foothills of the higher
mountains at Tsing Ling Kang, Shensi, at altitudes from 2000 to 5000 feet,
generally found at the edges of loess cliffs and on rocky slopes. There is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
a great deal of variation to be observed as regards size and shape of leaves,
density of foliage and general habits."</p>

<p>"40003. Wild peaches found on a mountain side, near Pai dja dien,
Shensi, at an elevation of 4000 feet; these small trees and bushes had borne
such a heavy crop that the ground beneath them was covered with a layer,
a few inches thick, of the small, yellowish, hairy fruits. The local inhabitants
didn't consider them worth collecting even, and they were rotting
and drying up."</p>

<p>"40004. Wild peaches occurring as tall shrubs in loess cliffs, at the
Tibetan frontier, Kagoba, Kansu, at elevations of 6000-8000 feet. Save
for some children who eat these wild peaches, they are otherwise considered
worthless wild fruit. Local name <i>Yeh t'ao</i>, meaning 'wild peach,' and
<i>Mao t'ao</i>, meaning 'hairy peach.'"</p>

<p>"40005. Wild peaches found on stony mountain slopes in a wild,
very sparsely populated country, near Kwa tsa, on Siku River, Kansu. No
fruit trees whatsoever are cultivated by the local settlers in the mountains,
and the way some of these peach bushes grow excludes them from ever
having been brought there by any man or even any quadruped; only birds
might have transported them."</p>

<p>In a letter to the author,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Mr. Meyer says further:</p>

<p>"Where did I find the peach wild? Well, I first came across it in loess
cliffs in southern Shensi at an elevation of about 4000 feet above sea. Later
on I found plenty of them in central Shensi, in southern Kansu and in
the Tibetan borderland, up to 7000 feet elevation above sea. All the
plants I found were freestone types, and according to the natives they all
have shell-pink flowers. In the mountains of the Chekiang Province,
however, I found a type which seems to be clingstone."</p>

<p>In still another letter sent me from the United States Department
of Agriculture, Mr. Meyer says:</p>

<p>"It is about one month ago since I wrote you last, and so far as real
distance is concerned, I have not advanced much, but we went over some
very interesting territory and I was lucky enough to discover the <i>real wild
peach</i>, growing in loess ravines some 2-3 days to the East from here, near a
village called <i>Tchao yu</i>. The plants are of smaller dimensions than our
cultivated strains, and the stones are somewhat different as regards shape
and grooves, but still on the whole there is little difference between a very
poor seedling-peach and this wild one.</p>

<p>These wild peaches are locally cut for firewood, for the fruits are
pretty near inedible, being small and having hard, sourish flesh. They
grow at the edges of deep loess ravines and on the steep, sloping bottom
of such ravines.  The Chinese locally do not call this peach '<i>yeh tao</i>'
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
or '<i>shan tao</i>' but '<i>Mao t'ao</i>,' meaning 'hairy peach.' In the vicinity
where they grow, no peaches are cultivated although half a day's journey
lower down, one meets with some poor looking trees in gardens.</p>

<p>The elevation I found them was almost exactly 4000 feet above sea.
I gathered some fruits, but they are not quite ripe; I am trying to ripen
them off, however, so that we may obtain at least a few ripe seeds. As a
stock, however, it has not the value the <i>Davidiana</i> peach has, not being as
vigorous and apparently being attacked by the same pests that infest
cultivated peaches. This 'find' is of great interest, however, showing
that wild peaches exist much nearer the coast than we suspected, and that
the peach naturally is a native of semi-arid regions."</p>

<p>The explorations made by Mr. Meyer cover, of course, but a small
part of the vast empire of China. Further search will, no doubt, show
many other localities in Central and Eastern Asia where the peach grows
naturally and has probably done so from time immemorial.</p>

<p>As all who consult them know, ancient authors are often at fault in
matters of history in determining the origin of cultivated plants but they
are usually fairly accurate in stating the date of culture of a plant in a
country. In the case of the peach the date of culture can be established
as so much earlier in China than elsewhere that history alone all but proves
its previous existence there in the wild state. In short, the peach was a
cultivated fruit in China before there were other agricultural communities
from which it could come; for, be it remembered, in China, according to
De Candolle, our best authority, agricultural and horticultural arts
flourished long before they had even begun elsewhere, unless, possibly,
Egypt be excepted, and here the peach, where it may be grown at all, is
surely an introduced plant.</p>

<p>A statement of the first known dates of peach-culture in various
countries is strong proof that its cultivation began in China. According
to De Candolle<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> the culture of the peach was "spoken of 2000 years before
its introduction into the Greco-Roman world, a thousand years before its
introduction into the lands of the Sanskrit-speaking race." As we have
said, the Bible and other Hebrew books do not mention the peach and there
is no Sanskrit name for it. Of the Greeks, Xenophon, 401 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, makes
no mention of the peach but Theophrastus, a little later, 322 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, speaks
of it as a fruit of Persia. Coming to the Romans, no mention is made of
the peach by Cato, 201 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, nor by Varro, 117-27 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, but Pliny, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
79, expressly states that the peach was imported by the Romans from
Persia not long before.</p>

<p>De Candolle gives no authority for his statement that the peach was
spoken of 2000 years before its introduction into Europe and I cannot
verify it; but a search through even such Chinese literature as is accessible
to one who does not read the Chinese language shows that the peach was
commonly spoken of in the literature of China several hundred years before
the Christian era. Two examples must suffice, taking those that seem
most authentic as to the identity of the peach. In the Shi-King, or book of
poetry, a collection of ancient Chinese poems made by Confucius (551-478
B. C.) the peach, in common with the plum, pear, jujube and other fruits,
is several times mentioned. According to the translator all of these poems
were written before the Sixth Century B. C., the oldest dating back eighteen
centuries. Thus in Book I,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Odes of Chow in the South, is the following
bit of verse:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="center">In Praise of a Bride</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Graceful and young the peach-tree stands;</span>
<span class="i0">How rich its flowers, all gleaming bright!</span>
<span class="i0">This bride to her new home repairs;</span>
<span class="i0">Chamber and house she'll order right.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Graceful and young the peach-tree stands;</span>
<span class="i0">Large crops of fruit it soon will show.</span>
<span class="i0">This bride to her new home repairs;</span>
<span class="i0">Chamber and house her sway shall know.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Graceful and young the peach-tree stands;</span>
<span class="i0">Its foliage clustering green and full.</span>
<span class="i0">This bride to her new home repairs;</span>
<span class="i0">Her household will attest her rule."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Other references to the peach may be found in Book IX,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> The Odes
of Wei, and Book XIII,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> The Odes of Kwei.</p>

<p>Superstitions and legends throw light on the antiquity of the objects
with which they are connected. It is significant that the Chinese alone
ascribe miraculous powers to the peach, their traditions of the properties
of different forms of this fruit being both numerous and very ancient.
M. Cibot, a French missionary among the Chinese, in a series of cyclopedic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
volumes on China, devotes a chapter to the peach in which, after describing
the peaches of the country and giving a full discussion of methods of
culture, he mentions numerous Chinese superstitions concerning this fruit.
He writes:<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>"The Chinese have for a long time preserved the history of the first
ages either in their books or in their traditions. The oldest of their books
have perished. They have saved only a part of their ancient national
works on the great wars and general uprisings, and the original traditions,
changed in a thousand ways, made into fables, finally corrupted by idolatry,
are today only chaos; but this chaos is not without any ray of light. Many
of these traditions, although disfigured, bear back too exactly to the
marvelous tales of the lost books to be able to mistake the beliefs of the
early ages. Thus, there are many traditions referring to the peach. Some
call it the tree of life, others the tree of death. Peaches lengthened to a
point, of large size, and colored red on one side, are regarded by the
Chinese as the symbol of a long life. In consequence of these ancient
national superstitions, peaches enter into all the ornaments of painting
and sculpture. They are saved for the salute to the new year. Here are
several ancient texts on the peach and its fruits:</p>

<p>From Chin-non-King: 'The peach 'Yu' signifies death and
eternal life. If one has been able to eat it enough times, it saves the body
from corruption till the end of the world.' From Chin-y-King: 'There
is in the Orient a peach whose almond, eaten, makes eternal life.' From
Chou-y-Ki: 'Whoever eats this fruit (the peach 'Yu' from the Koue-liou
Mountain) obtains immortal life.'</p>

<p>Still other texts could be cited but I will merely remark that in all
the peach is connected with immortality. Again we find that certain
peaches can not be offered by the ancients in sacrifice, and that the premature
blossoming of another peach signifies great calamities. To quote
again: From Sin-lin: 'In the garden of Yang was the peach of death;
whoever approached it must die.' From Fong-fou-teng: 'It is said in
the book of Hoang-ti that two brothers found on a mountain a peach tree
under which were a hundred demons to cause death to men.' From
Lietchouen, on the subject of the evils which afflict the earth: 'the tree
of Knowledge is the peach.'"</p>

<p>Very interesting and illuminating as to the age of the peach in China,
is an account given by Dr. Yamei Kin<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>  who was asked by a member of
the staff of the Office of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction, United
States Department of Agriculture, for information concerning the peach-blossoms.
After describing the several kinds of blossoms borne by Chinese
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
peaches, the writer gives some of the superstitions and legends which the
Chinese connect with the peach.</p>

<p>"The ordinary name for pink is peach flower color, and notwithstanding
the love of Chinese for color, it is used sparingly, in fact, owing to its
being associated with the peach blossom, seems to have an unsavory significance,
as I found when I came home one day with a pink satin brocade
gown that I had just purchased. My people held up their hands in horror,
and exclaimed it was a mercy that I did not intend to wear that here, it
would only do for outside countries that did not know about peach flowers,
which remarks led me to leave it in America when I came back, though
it was a very lovely delicate color and one of my prettiest gowns.</p>

<p>The reason for this prejudice is owing to its symbolism. Just as
the violet is considered in western lands to be the symbol of modest worth,
so the plum is that of feminine virtue in China and the peach flower the
opposite. Not even the beauty of its color, whether delicate pink or deep
cerise, redeems it from this fatal significance. In order that there may
be no possible opportunity for a 'peach flower heart' to spring up
unawares in some girl of respectable family, it is not considered wise to
plant a peach of any kind near the bed room windows of the court yards
inhabited by the women, yet peach wands are supposed to be especially
useful to beat off all evil spirits, only they must be plucked during a solar
eclipse and a hole bored through one end for hanging up by, during a lunar
eclipse, which perhaps accounts for their fewness, as during those times
in the old days the people were generally busily occupied in beating gongs
and firing off crackers to drive away the heavenly dogs which were supposed
to be devouring those luminaries, and no one had time to think of making
peach wands. The lucky possessor of an efficacious peach wand is supposed
to be able to sleep at night with it under his pillow in full confidence
that no evil spirits can harm him.</p>

<p>Taoism from early days has taken the peach as its particular fruit,
signifying longevity, much as the apples of Hesperides were symbolic in
the Grecian mythology.</p>

<p>Furthermore peach stones are often made into rosaries which are
considered specially fine. There is a collection of tales by one Cornaby
to be found in almost every library called 'A String of Peach Stones.'
And a host of legends cluster around the tale of Sun, the stone monkey,
eating the peaches of immortality stolen from the gardens of the genii,
whereby he attains immortality. This theme is seen elaborated in many
scenes, that decorate pottery, textiles, and congratulatory scrolls.</p>

<p>I wish that I were not tied down so much by tedious detail in the
medical work, as there is a most interesting book that needs to be translated
telling much of the folk lore of the peach interwoven with the plot,
which is supposed to be the journey of Hsien tsang to bring back the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
sacred sutras of Buddha from India. It is said that this is an actual
historic occurrence, but this tale is evidently semi-religious and allegorical,
as well, combining in itself the characteristics of Bunyan's Pilgrim's
Progress, Hans Christian Andersen, and the Arabian Nights, if you can
imagine such a mixture, yet giving graphic pictures of Chinese life in
various phases that are as true as when the book was written.</p>

<p>One of the most charming legends of peach flower lore is that of
the 'Peach Blossom Fountain,' an allegory written by T'ao Yuan Ming
between <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 365-427, describing how a fisherman got lost one day and
penetrating up a river finds himself in a creek bordered with many peach
trees full of bloom, at the end of which he comes upon a small mountain
in which is a cave which he traverses and enters on a new country where
there is every sign of prosperity, every one is courteous to each other,
kindliness and contentment prevail, but they wear the garb of the times of
the First Emperor some five centuries previous and have been lost to the
rest of the country ever since. The fisherman returns after a sojourn
with them, and tells his fellow villagers of this wonderful country and stirs
up so much interest that finally the governor of the province joins in the
search for this wonderful country, but it is all of no avail and at last the
fisherman realizes that he will never more see the peach blossom days of his
youth with its rosy dreams and ideals that come but once in a lifetime."</p>

<p>Lastly, a significant fact suggesting the Chinese origin of the peach
is found in the behavior of this fruit in America. The peach is more at
home in North America than in any other part of the world unless it be
China. Now, that there is a pomological alliance between eastern Asia
and eastern America is well known. The remarkable relationship between
the plants of the two regions was first set forth by Asa Gray and subsequent
writers have added much to what he told us. The explanation lies, as
all agree, in similarities in climate. Now, with this relationship of the
wild and cultivated floras of eastern America and China in mind, the rapid
acclimation and acclimatization of the peach in the United States are
readily understood if we accept China as the habitat of this fruit. On
the other hand, the natural plant-products of Persia find life anything
but easy in eastern America.</p>

<p>There is but one further consideration before beginning the history
of the peach as a cultivated fruit. Thomas Andrew Knight and Charles
Darwin contended that the peach is a modified almond. This hypothesis
would scarcely deserve consideration were it not for the high authority
of the men who espoused it&mdash;the judgments of a Knight and a Darwin
cannot be overlooked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<h3>HAS THE PEACH COME FROM THE ALMOND?</h3>

<p>In the light of evolution every plant has been preceded by another
and since the peach and almond have many characters in common, one
may have descended from the other. But as to which, if either, is the
parent species it would seem idle to speculate with the shreddy and patchy
knowledge we now possess of the descent of plants. Yet Thomas Andrew
Knight, the greatest horticultural authority of his time and one of the
leading experimenters of all time in this field of agriculture, maintained
that the peach is a modified almond. His theory received the support of
several of the leading English horticulturists of the last century and Darwin
gave it credence to the extent of collecting data for its substantiation.</p>

<p>Knight believed that the almond and the peach constituted a single
species and that by selection under cultivation an almond could ultimately
be turned into a peach.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> He sought proof for his theory in
hybridization and on a tree raised from the seed of an almond fertilized
by peach-pollen produced a fruit with soft and melting flesh and in all
characteristics more like the peach than the almond. This experiment,
which in the light of our present knowledge of the laws of inheritance does
not in the least illuminate the hypothesis with which Knight started,
carried on in the medieval days of plant-breeding, convinced not only
Knight in his belief that the peach may be bred from the almond but
led others, even down to our own time, to accept the theory.</p>

<p>Thus, a writer, presumably Lindley, in <i>The Gardener's Chronicle</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> in
1856 says "we are justified in the conclusion that the Almond bears about
the same relation to the Peach that the Crab bears to the Cultivated
Apple." Later, in the same article, the descent is pictured as follows:</p>

<table summary=" ">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdrt">"1.</td>
    <td>Almond became more fleshy&mdash;Bad clingstone.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdrt">2.</td>
    <td>Bad clingstone became more fleshy&mdash;Good clingstone.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdrt">3.</td>
    <td>Good clingstone became more fleshy&mdash;Our soft peaches.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdrt">4.</td>
    <td>Soft peach sported, receding toward the original fleshy type and lost its wool&mdash;Nectarine."</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Another high authority in his time, Thomas Rivers,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> in 1863, held that
peaches, if left to a state of nature would degenerate into thick-fleshed
almonds and makes the positive statement that he has "one or two seedling
peaches approaching very nearly to that state."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>Darwin,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> in 1868, considers Knight's supposition at length and while
he does not positively accept it, yet lends it his support by quoting several
authors who put forth proofs in favor of it. His most positive statement
in discussing the theory referring to facts regarding the origin of the peach
is: "The supposition, however, that the peach is a modified almond
which acquired its present character at a comparatively late period, would,
I presume, account for these facts."</p>

<p>Carrière,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> one of the most eminent French pomologists of the last
century, is the chief French champion of the theory that the peach came
from the almond and devotes several pages in his estimable work, <i>Variétés
De Pêchers</i>, in demonstrating that the one is a form of the other. His
arguments, however, are but amplifications of those of Knight and Lindley
though he cites more intermediate forms than either of the English writers&mdash;so
many that they go far toward convincing one of the correctness of
his views. There is the feeling, however, in the case of Carrière, in the
light of present knowledge, that his botanical evidence is pushed a little
too far for full credulity.</p>

<p>Knight, Lindley, Rivers, Darwin and Carrière, the men holding the
theory whose opinions are most worthy consideration, fell into error, as
we think, through attaching too much importance to likenesses in the
fruits of the peach and almond and because they became confused in
following the behavior of the two fruits under hybridization. As we shall
show later in discussing the characters of the peach, this fruit differs from
the almond in other characters than those of the fruit&mdash;characters not at
all likely to be changed by cultivation and selection as would all those of
the fruits. Knight's proof from hybridization was purely speculative.
The fact that the peach and almond may be crossed, giving intermediate
forms, nowadays would not be looked upon as proof that the two necessarily
belong to one species. However, in the light of the knowledge in
existence at the beginning of the last century regarding the crossing of
plants, we need not apologize for the inference that Knight drew from his
simple experiment.</p>

<p>Students of heredity would find almost conclusive proof that the
peach is not a modified almond&mdash;a descendant, say, in this geologic period
at least&mdash;in the fact that there is no recorded case of a peach fertilized
by a peach producing an almond, or <i>vice versa</i>. If the relationship were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
at all close, if the two species had had a common origin even though in
rather remote times, if they were nearly enough related readily to hybridize
or be hybridized, it would be expected that now and then, as in the case
of a nectarine, the peach would produce an almond or the almond a peach.</p>

<p>Geographical botany also opposes Knight's hypothesis, as De Candolle<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
points out, for, as he plainly shows, the almond had its origin in
western Asia, it being found truly wild in many parts of south-western
Asia and having been cultivated many centuries before the peach was
known in these regions. On the other hand, the almond was not known
in China before the Christian era whereas the peach had been cultivated
there at least 2000 years anterior to the introduction of the almond. With
such widely separated habitats, the two fruits can hardly be considered as
parent and offspring.</p>

<p>We cannot close our eyes to the patent relationships of the peach and
the almond. That the two constitute but one species, as we now consider
species, or that they bear the close relationship of the peach and the
nectarine, probably no one now in high authority will concede. But for
the weight of the names we have used, and the fact that the theory still
finds supporters, Knight's hypothesis, the outcropping of a speculative
mind in a speculative age, might have been overlooked or dismissed with
a word.</p>

<h3>THE PEACH IN ASIA</h3>

<p>We must have more knowledge of the peach in Asia than the bare
fact that it originated somewhere in the vast empire of China. We want,
first, to know what the characters of the prototypal peach were. If we
can get some idea of the original wild peach of China we shall know something
of how this fruit has been improved by man and, perhaps, something
of its future potentialities. Second, though not essential to this
study, it will be profitable to peach-growers to inquire whether there are
types of peaches still remaining in China that might be improved under
western cultivation. If so, we want them, since our cultivated peaches
are not free from faults, some of which we might get rid of by the interjection
of new blood. It is now about seventy years since Robert Fortune,
the adventurous English plant-collector, began dipping into the horticultural
treasures of China; and recent explorations make plain that there
are still riches in plants in that country&mdash;the fact that they can now be
brought through the "open door," instead of as spoils to be smuggled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
out, makes it easier to obtain any new types of peaches that may now be
found.</p>

<p>What were the characters of the prototypal peach in China? The
few records that have come down through the ages do not enable us to
form much of a picture of the primitive peach. But plants do not change
quickly in China, for their orchard-cultivation is not as intensive nor
selection as assiduously practiced as in western countries, so that we are
warranted in assuming that cultivation for forty centuries has not greatly
changed this fruit. Besides, it is probable that the wild forms, whether
truly wild or reverted escapes from cultivation, now represent closely
the original indigenous stocks of the peach. Luckily, we have trustworthy
sources of information in regard to both the wild and the cultivated peaches
as they now grow in China. We are at this time concerned, it should be
said, only with the common peach, <i>Prunus persica</i>.</p>

<p>Fortune began botanical explorations in China in 1844, since which
time one enthusiast after another, thirsting for botanical spoils and honors,
has brought from eastern Asia and Europe to America, varieties and species
of ornamental and agricultural plants. In the accounts of these exploring
and collecting expeditions, there are many records of peaches, wild and
cultivated, that are now growing in China and from these we may piece out
a fair description of the original races of this fruit. The United States
Department of Agriculture, through its agricultural explorers, collaborators
and correspondents in the Office of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction,
has given special attention to agricultural plants and from the accounts
of the workers in this department alone, we can get a good picture of the
peach of the Twentieth Century in China which, as we think, will represent
very well the original stock from which all peaches have come.</p>

<p>It is now almost the unanimous judgment of scientists that the characters
of plants are independent entities which are thrown into various
relationships with each other in individuals and groups of individuals as
varieties and species. This conception of unit-characters lies at the
foundation of botanical and horticultural descriptions and of plant-breeding.
It is more important, then, to know what the characters of Chinese peaches
were and are than to attempt to describe in full the wild and cultivated
peaches of China. In this, a horticultural study, it answers our purpose
to consider chiefly the characters of the fruits.</p>

<p>The fruit-characters that differentiate races and varieties of cultivated
peaches in America are ten, as follows: Downy skin; smooth skin;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
white flesh; yellow flesh; red flesh; flesh clinging to the stone; flesh free from
the stone; shape more or less round; shape roundish but decidedly beaked;
shape distinctly flat. Let us see by direct quotations from the workers
in the United States Department of Agriculture how many of these ten
fruit-characters are named in the wild and cultivated Chinese peaches
of today.</p>

<p><i>Downy skin.</i>&mdash;A downy skin is the normal condition of the peach.
This character is found in all of the peaches to be mentioned in this discussion
except those under the next heading.</p>

<p><i>Smooth skin.</i>&mdash;"28963&mdash;From Samarkand, Turkestan."<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>"A small nectarine of very firm flesh and of subacid flavor; red
throughout; from a distance resembles a crab apple more than anything
else. Said to come from Chartchui."</p>

paper, until February. Though a cling stone it is luscious, sweet and
aromatic, and of unusual size, reaching a pound in weight and is so prized
by the Chinese that as much as 15 cents apiece is paid for it in the region
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
where it is grown; every year the Feitcheng peaches are sent as a present
to the Imperial court in Pekin."</p>

<p>The evidence given encourages the belief that in the native peaches
of China may be found all of the characters that distinguish cultivated
peaches wheresoever grown. The smooth-skinned peach, or nectarine,
from the evidence at my command, is not common in eastern China but in
Chinese and Russian Turkestan it is evidently one of the commonest fruits.
Neither does yellow flesh appear to be a common character of peaches of
eastern China but is now and again mentioned so that it may be put down
as existing in the peaches of the region. Bear in mind that the accounts
given are but random ones taken by persons not more interested in peaches
than in other agricultural products and covering, of course, but a very small
part of the vast region under the dominion of China. There is, no doubt,
much to be learned about the peaches of Asia in future explorations.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>In America, at least, certain characters of peaches, as flatness, smooth
skin, red flesh and prolonged beak are looked upon as comparatively new
in this fruit. At any rate, varieties having these relatively rare characters
are spoken of as sports and pomologists, as we shall see, not infrequently
announce the date of birth of one or another of these characters.
Now, a careful examination of the evidence, scant though it is, will carry
conviction to all that none of the prominent characters of peaches have
originated within the period covered by history&mdash;all exist in China and
probably have so existed since time beyond record.</p>

<p>The size and color of the blossoms are distinguishing characters of
races and varieties of cultivated peaches, less valuable in classification than
the fruit-characters we have been discussing only because they are less
numerous. Peach-blossoms fall into four very distinct kinds: Petals
large and pink; petals intermediate in size and pink or red; petals small
and red or reddish; and petals large and white. Through the United
States Department of Agriculture, I am in possession of copies of nine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
letters from Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction correspondents of the
United States Department in China who had been asked to report on the
size and color of peach-blossoms in the parts of China in which they lived.
The information thus obtained is most interesting but space forbids considering
it further at present than to say that it indubitably establishes
the fact that peaches with the four kinds of blossoms are found in China.
This further encourages the belief, just set forth, that the essential characters
of peaches are old, of great fixity and originated in China at a time
in the past on which it would be idle to conjecture.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that there are peaches in China with at least
two characters not found in any American varieties. Two varieties are
mentioned as having "white stones." There is no peach in America with
stones that could be described as white though several early white-fleshed
peaches have light-colored stones. This character is unimportant and
seems, from the brief descriptions of the varieties having such stones, not
to be correlated with other especially desirable characters, yet such a peach
would, at least, add an interesting novelty to the flora of this fruit. The
other character, that of late keeping, appears to have more value. A
peach that would "keep for several months" or one ripening in September
"that can be kept, when wrapped in tissue paper, until February," is
highly desirable. No doubt through the efforts of the workers in the
United States Department of Agriculture we shall sooner or later be growing
these peaches in America.</p>

<p>As the probable home of the peach, we have given China so much
space in this discussion of the peach in Asia that we can now but briefly
summarize what is known of this fruit in other Asiatic countries.</p>

<p><i>The peach in Japan.</i>&mdash;From <i>Fruit Culture in Japan</i><a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> it is patent that
the peach is one of the leading fruits of the country. In number of varieties
of the several fruits grown in Japan the peach is exceeded only by the
persimmon&mdash;ninety-five peaches and two nectarines being listed, all
having Japanese names. The following account gives some idea of the
peach-industry as carried on in Japan:</p>

<p>"There are a number of varieties of our native peaches and nectarines.
From the extreme south of Formosa to Hokkaido, local forms are cultivated
side by side with Western and Chinese varieties, which are all much
superior to ours in all respects. During the past twenty years, the growing
of introduced peaches has replaced the native one with striking rapidity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
Their growing seems to be naturally limited in Hokkaido to the south part
up to about 43 degrees N. L. The mid-season and late varieties do not
properly ripen there and peach growing consequently does not develop to
be a profitable industry in Hokkaido. Peaches are rather easy to cultivate
and seem to be less susceptible to the effects of climate, than apples,
provided suitable sites and soil be given. Consequently peach orchards
are found scattered here and there all over the country. For the peaches
there is no difference between the two longitudinal halves of Japan. At
present, large orchards of peaches, regularly planted and trained, are
found on the alluvial lowlands and hillsides. The heavy rainfall during
June and July causes an overluxuriance of growth and considerable portion
of the fruits drop down without reaching maturity. To prevent the damage
from the parasites our people have learned through experience the important
operation of bagging. On the loamy soils, good qualities of fruits
may be attained, but the growers are accustomed to prefer light sandy soils
to insure success. Sometimes rather dry hillsides give good results."</p>

<p><i>The peach in Turkestan and Persia.</i>&mdash;We shall become too deeply
involved if we attempt to trace the cultivation of peaches in all of the
countries of Asia. A sentence each suffices for other regions than China
and Japan, excepting Turkestan, where the peach seems preeminently at
home, and must therefore have more than a word.</p>

<p>The peach is commonly grown in Mongolia and Cochin China.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> Several
kinds of peaches are cultivated in the north of India.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> The peach requires
the greatest care to ensure success in the north-east of India.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> A correspondent
of the United States Department of Agriculture at Kashgar,
British India, describes a nectarine grown there wanting "a hot but only
a short summer."<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> Meyer, Agricultural Explorer for the United States
Department of Agriculture, found a variety of peach growing at Kirin,
Mongolia, not far from Vladivostock, which he says "is the most northern
locality where I have yet found peaches."<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> These references might be
multiplied but enough are given to show that the peach grows wild or
cultivated wherever the climate permits in central and eastern Asia.</p>

<p>The peach seems to be quite as much at home, as highly prized and as
commonly grown in Russian Turkestan, northern Persia, Trans-Caucasia
and Asia Minor&mdash;the countries of western Asia&mdash;as in the eastern part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
of the continent. The Chinese early discovered trade routes over the
mountains from the center of Asia to Kashmir, Bokhara and northern
Persia. What more probable than that in remote times the seeds of peaches
should have been carried westward from China and the peach thus have
been introduced into western Asia where it at once found a congenial soil
and climate. The peach-tree is so easily raised from the pit that its diffusion
along routes of travel must have been very rapid.</p>

<p>Of many accounts of the peaches of this region, long and short, perhaps
the following from Mr. Albert Regel gives, in the space to be spared, the
best idea of the extent of the peach-region in western Asia and the races
represented&mdash;races rather than varieties, for of the latter there must be
legions since we are told the trees are grown from seed. Regel,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> a physician
by vocation, lived in Turkestan for nine years and collected fruits and
flowers as an avocation. He seems to have penetrated every nook and
corner of Turkestan and adjacent regions. Of peaches and nectarines he
says:</p>

<p>"Next to the pomegranate, the Asiatics prize the peach, and the
Oriental poetry compares its lusciousness to the fruits of Paradise. The
culture of the peach reaches its northern limit in the district of the Ili.
The young plants, which, as throughout Asia, are grown from the seed,
without grafting, suffer greatly there from frost and require careful covering;
nevertheless the large, smooth, red and the rough, hairy, yellow fruit
of the Chinese varieties develop excellent characteristics. According to
the observations of the naturalist Wilkins, there are 40 varieties in the
Kokan district, among them some Chinese ones. In the South the peach
extends to Afghanistan and Tshotral; its proper home, however, is Northern
Persia to the Caucasus. In Darvas the peach forms trees 30 feet high with
broad tops. The rough-skinned giant peaches of the garden of Kalaichumb
are of unsurpassed lusciousness and aroma, and most inviting
bloom (tinting of the cheeks). They attain the size of an average apple.
The fruitfulness of this variety is so great that the leaves seem to be concealed
by the peaches. The Bokhariots prize the smaller rough skinned,
and red cheeked variety at Tchaspak, which is distinguished by strong
aroma and firm, almost astringent flesh. The yellow peaches are especially
sweet. The number of rough-skinned kinds at Kalaichumb is considerable.</p>

<p>The smooth-skinned nectarines of this region, among which there are
smaller, pale yellow varieties and very large red cheeked ones, are of
unusually fine flavor and melting flesh; but they are equalled by the
nectarines of Samarkand. There are also small sweet yellow kinds, which
stand half way between the rough coated and smooth coated peaches.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
Such an one grows in the exposed region of Paendish. In Jasqulam, a
small rough-skinned, red peach with astringent flesh and musky aroma
flourishes. Roshan, the district of Barpaendsha, and Surshan on the lower
Hund, produce later ripening and less valuable varieties, than the territory
of the lower Paendish."</p>

<p>Another quotation shows the intensity of the orcharding in some parts
of this favored land of fruits. In his chapter on the Zarafshan Valley,
Schuyler says:<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>"The gardens constitute the beauty of all this land. The long rows
of poplar and elm trees, the vineyards, the dark foliage of the pomegranate
over the walls, transport one at once to the plains of Lombardy or of
Southern France. In the early spring the outskirts of the city, and indeed
the whole valley, are one mass of white and pink, with the bloom of almond
and peach, of cherry and apple, of apricot and plum, which perfume the air
for miles around. These gardens are the favourite dwelling-places in the
summer, and well may they be. Nowhere are fruits more abundant, and
of some varieties it can be said that nowhere are they better. The apricots
and nectarines I think it would be impossible to surpass anywhere. These
ripen in June, and from that time until winter fruit and melons are never
lacking. Peaches, though smaller in size, are better in flavour than the
best of England, but they are far surpassed by those of Delaware. The
big blue plums of Bukhara are celebrated through the whole of Asia. The
cherries are mostly small and sour. The best apples come either from
Khiva, or from Suzak, to the north of Turkestan, but the small white
pears of Tashkent are excellent in their way. The quince, as with us, is
cultivated only for jams or marmalades, or for flavouring soup."</p>

<p>West-central Asia, "the cradle of races," is, as well, the cradle of
fruits and vegetables and he who would know more of its orchards, gardens
and vineyards should read Schuyler's <i>Turkestan</i> and Lansdell's <i>Russian
Central Asia</i>. We have quoted from the first-named book and now close
the discussion of peaches in Asia by a few brief quotations from Lansdell,
taking a few from many to bring out points worth noting. We
usually think of flat peaches as belonging to southeastern Asia, yet Lansdell
found them in west-central Asia:<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> "Here we bought our first ripe
grapes and nectarines. Apricots ripen at Kuldja at the beginning of July,
and we were, therefore, too late for them, but of late peaches, that ripen
early in August, we came in for the last, flat in form, about an inch and
a half in diameter and half an inch in thickness. They tasted fairly well,
but there was little flesh on the stone."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>Nectarines, as we have mentioned before, seem to be especially plentiful
in this region:<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> "In the market (Vierny) we also bought grapes, and,
still better, small but luscious nectarines, the latter for a halfpenny each,
of which, as I sat over my writing at night, I ate so many as to alarm
Mr. Sevier, whose medical instincts led him to fear for the consequences.
All went well, however, and I never stinted myself from that time onward
from Central Asian fruit, and I am thankful to say was not once
inconvenienced thereby."</p>

<p>As throwing light on the wild fruits of this region, we have Lansdell's
statement that there are whole forests of almond trees and many species
of cherries, plums, apples, pears and apricots, but wild peaches are not
mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>On another page we are told that peaches in Bokhara are of three
varieties, red, white and green, and in a foot-note that they are grown as
follows:<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> "When sown, the stone is put in the earth two fingers deep,
before the frosts set in; water is then let in and allowed to freeze; after that,
earth is put over it and left till the following spring, when the young shoots
are transplanted at intervals of four paces. The best peaches are said
to come from Samarkand."</p>

<p>One is tempted to enlarge upon fruit-possibilities in these west-Asiatic
valleys. Without much strain upon the imagination it is easy to conjure
up visions of great fruit-industries in west Asia rivaling those of our own
Pacific Coast when communications with European markets are opened
and if the people now there or those who may migrate there begin to make
use of their opportunities and to take advantage of the best that art and
science now offer horticulture. In the event of such a development,
peaches, fresh and dried, will not be the least of the products of the region.</p>

<h3>THE PEACH IN EUROPE</h3>

<p>One finds treasures of experience and inspiration for narrative in the
history of the peach in Europe. But to present a systematic record of
the peach as it traveled from country to country after its introduction into
ancient Greece would require a volume and a long one, which, interesting
and profitable as it might be, could hardly be justified in this work.
Present purposes are best served by attempting only to point out the
landmarks in the history and development of the peach from the time it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
left Asia until it reached America. The first landmark is in the introduction
of the peach into Greece.</p>

<p><i>The peach in Greece.</i>&mdash;As to the approximate date and the manner
in which the peach reached Greece, there is now common accord among
those who may be considered authorities on the history of fruits. Theophrastus
(332 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>) was the first Greek to mention the peach, speaking of
it as a "Persian fruit." It may be, of course, that the peach came to
Greece from Asia Minor or Persia at an earlier date. One might well
suspect that if peaches were growing in Persia at the time of the retreat
of the Ten Thousand (401 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>), since the army must have traversed the
country in which, according to some, the peach is native and at least had
probably then been introduced, the taste of so pleasant a fruit would have
inspired some soldier of the retreating Greeks to carry seeds to his western
home. But Xenophon, historian of the retreat and a writer on agriculture
as well as of war, does not mention the peach as he almost certainly would
have done had it occupied a prominent place among the agricultural
products of his time.</p>

<p>There is another story of the introduction of the peach into Greece
that may be mentioned to separate fact from fable. Some of the old
writers assert that the peach came to Greece from Persia by the way of
Egypt. Such statements are founded on a traditionary tale first printed
by Pliny to the effect that this fruit was sent into Egypt by the kings of
Persia to poison the Egyptians. Pliny<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> denies that the kings of Persia
had the peach transplanted into Egypt from motives of revenge but
evidently is under the belief that the peach came from Egypt for he
says:</p>

<p>"As to the peach-tree, it has been only introduced of late years, and
with considerable difficulty; so much so, that it is perfectly barren in the
Isle of Rhodes, the first resting-place that it found after leaving Egypt."</p>

<p>We would like to amplify the bare statement that Alexander brought
the peach to Greece 332 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, but this single fact, if it be a fact, seems to
constitute the recorded history of the peach in Greece before the Christian
era. Dioscorides, about 64 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span>, was the next Greek to mention the peach
but he discusses it with reference to its medicinal properties and does not
enlighten us greatly as to its horticultural standing. The fact that the
several Greek writers whose books have come down to us from the period
under consideration do not mention the peach does not argue that this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
fruit was not then growing in Greece; for classicists, then as now, seldom
got down to earth and the things growing in it.</p>

<p><i>The peach in Italy.</i>&mdash;Naturally one goes to the oldest book in Latin
literature on agriculture to look for the beginnings of peach-culture in
Italy. This, as every student knows, is <i>De Re Rustica</i>, a work on farming,
gardening and fruit-growing by Cato (235-150 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>) on whom posterity
has bestowed the appellation "Sturdiest Roman of Them All." Cato
mentions most of our common orchard-fruits, as well as our field crops and
garden-plants, but the peach is not in his list of fruits; neither does Varro
(117-27 B. C.), the next great Roman writer on agriculture, seem to have
known the peach though he mentions choice varieties of cultivated cherries,
which at his time had but newly been introduced into Rome.</p>

<p>To Vergil (71-19 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>), we are indebted for the first reference to the
peach in Roman literature. The "Prince of Latin Poets," writing on
agriculture, orcharding and gardening, in the Georgics, mentions the peach
in these graceful lines:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Myself will search our planted grounds at home,</span>
<span class="i0">For downy peaches and the glossy plum."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Columella, writing in the next generation after Vergil, about 40 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span>,
adopts or starts the story of the peach being a poisonous gift sent from
Persia to Egypt:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And apples, which most barbarous Persia sent,</span>
<span class="i0">With native poison arm'd (as fame relates):</span>
<span class="i0">But now they've lost their pow'r to kill, and yield</span>
<span class="i0">Ambrosial juice, and have forgot to hurt;</span>
<span class="i0">And of their country still retain the name."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Some hold, however, that Columella refers not to the peach, "persica"
but to "persa" a quite different fruit. But unquestionably, according
to commentators, Columella has the peach in mind in these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Those of small size to ripen make great haste;</span>
<span class="i0">Such as great Gaul bestows observe due time</span>
<span class="i0">And season, not too early, nor too late."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>By these tokens do we know that the peach was cultivated in Italy
some years before the Christian era.</p>

<p>In Pliny's remarkable compend of the natural history lore that existed
at the beginning of the Christian era, we have the first information worthy
of note on the peach in Italy. His statements, though they throw more
light on what the peach then was than the writings of any one until his
time, taking a more utilitarian turn than those of the Greeks, are confusing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
and do not enlighten us greatly either as to the history of the peach,
or as to its pomological standing. Still, Pliny's observations constitute
an important landmark in the history of this fruit and we must give them
full consideration. First, let us give attention to Pliny's account of the
introduction of the peach into Italy. He devotes Chapter 13, Book XV,
to "The Peach" confining his observations to historical references but in
it so confounds peaches, plums and other trees that we learn but little as
to when, whence or how the peach came to the Romans. Since this reference
is much quoted, however, despite its indefiniteness, we give it in full.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>"The name of 'Persica,' or 'Persian apple,' given to this fruit,
fully proves that it is an exotic in both Greece as well as Asia, and that
it was first introduced from Persis. As to the wild plum, it is a well-known
fact that it will grow anywhere; and I am, therefore, the more surprised
that no mention has been made of it by Cato, more particularly
as he has pointed out the method of preserving several of the wild fruits
as well. As to the peach-tree, it has been only introduced of late years,
and with considerable difficulty; so much so, that it is perfectly barren
in the Isle of Rhodes, the first resting-place that it found after leaving
Egypt.</p>

<p>It is quite untrue that the peach which grows in Persia is poisonous,
and produces dreadful tortures, or that the kings of that country, from
motives of revenge, had it transplanted in Egypt, where, through the nature
of the soil, it lost all its evil properties&mdash;for we find that it is of the
'persea' that the more careful writers have stated all this, a totally
different tree, the fruit of which resembles the red myxa, and, indeed,
cannot be successfully cultivated anywhere but in the East. The learned
have also maintained that it was not introduced from Persis into Egypt
with the view of inflicting punishment, but say that it was planted at
Memphis by Perseus; for which reason it was that Alexander gave orders
that the victors should be crowned with it in the games which he instituted
there in honour of his ancestor; indeed, this tree has always leaves
and fruit upon it, growing immediately upon the others. It must be quite
evident to every one that all our plums have been introduced since the
time of Cato."</p>

<p>Our author's discussion of the kinds of peaches and of their market
value is somewhat more satisfactory. In Chapter 11, Book XV, entitled
"Six Varieties of the Peach," Pliny again discusses several fruits but in
the last paragraph confines himself to the peach and puts on record the
first account of varieties of this fruit. The chapter follows in full:<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>"Under the head of apples, we include a variety of fruits, although
of an entirely different nature, such as the Persian apple, for instance,
and the pomegranate, of which, when speaking of the tree, we have already
enumerated nine varieties. The pomegranate has a seed within, enclosed
in a skin; the peach has a stone inside. Some among the pears, also, known
as 'libralia,' show, by their name, what a remarkable weight they attain.</p>

<p>Among the peaches the palm must be awarded to the duracinus:
the Gallic and the Asiatic peach are distinguished respectively by the
names of the countries of their origin. They ripen at the end of autumn,
though some of the early kinds are ripe in the summer. It is only within
the last thirty years that these last have been introduced; originally they
were sold at the price of a denarius apiece. Those known as the 'supernatia'
come from the country of the Sabines, but the 'popularia' grow
everywhere. This is a very harmless fruit, and a particular favourite
with invalids: some, in fact, have sold before this as high as thirty
sesterces apiece, a price that has never been exceeded by any other fruit.
This, too, is the more to be wondered at, as there is none that is a worse
keeper: for, when it is once plucked, the longest time that it will keep is
a couple of days; and so sold it must be, fetch what it may."</p>

<p>The first of Pliny's six varieties is the "Persian Apple"&mdash;"<i>malum
persicum</i>" in the original text. It is well to note the author's statement
that "Under the head of apples, we include a variety of fruits." A literal
translation of the Latin word <i>malum</i> in Pliny has brought about many
misunderstandings. Beside the peach, pear and pomegranate grouped
here as "apples," the apricot, orange, citron and no doubt other fruits
come "under the head of apples." The "Persian apple," then, must be
counted as one of Pliny's "six varieties of peaches." From the name we
know whence the Romans had the peach.</p>

<p>The second variety is the duracinus, to which, among peaches, "the
palm must be awarded." The name translated literally is "hard-berry"
and must refer to the firmness of the flesh. Despite the fact that De Candolle<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
and others hold that Pliny does not mention the nectarine, "duracinus"
can hardly be other than the nectarine&mdash;at least the name fits
the nectarine better than it does any peach.</p>

<p>The third and fourth of Pliny's peaches are the "Gallic" and
"Asiatic," "distinguished respectively by the names of the countries of
their origin." Can it be possible that there is a peach native to France?
We should say at once that this is but one of Pliny's inaccuracies were it
not for the fact that several of the highest French pomological authorities
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
state that certain races of the peach are natives of southern France.
Duhamel Du Monceau<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> and Leroy<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> are chief champions of this belief and
the latter says that Mayer, Calvel and Carrière, other French authorities,
are of the same opinion. These French writers offer no substantial proofs
and botanists do not agree with them; it seems, weighing the evidence
at this distance, as if they had copied Columella and Pliny too closely.
The fact that the peach is a perfectly naturalized denizen of parts of France,
of course, gives color to the belief that it is a native and not an exotic in
that country. Quite similarly, our early botanists, including so careful
an observer as Bartram, were of the opinion that the peach belonged to
America for the reason that they found it growing wild in our southern
woods&mdash;an escape from early Spanish settlers. Pliny's Gallic peach,
probably, was a descendant of an early introduction from some outside
source. How the "Asiatic peach" of our quotation differs from the
"Persian apple" does not appear except in its origin, it probably having
come more or less directly from Asia Minor which in Pliny's time seems
to have been Asia.</p>

<p>The last two of Pliny's six varieties are those known as "supernatia"
which "come from the country of the Sabines" and the "popularia"
which "grow everywhere." Whether supernatia, meaning "from above,"
refers to the fact that this peach grows in the high and mountainous country
of the Sabines or to its being a choice variety, cannot be said. Probably,
however, it designates choice peaches while the "popularia" which grow
everywhere refers to the common run of this fruit.</p>

<p>Peaches were profitable in Rome in Pliny's time, for they sold "as
high as thirty sesterces apiece." A sesterce is four and one-half cents
so that the possible price of a peach in Rome 1900 years ago was $1.35.
The Roman peach-grower was at the mercy of the seasons as are those
of nowadays for we read that when once plucked the peach could be kept
but a couple of days, "so sold it must be, fetch what it may."</p>

<p>The statement that the peach is a "particular favorite with invalids,"
reminds us that the ancients ascribe various medicinal properties to
nearly all plants and Pliny sets forth those of the peach as follows:<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>"Peaches, again, are more wholesome than plums; and the same is
the case with the juice of the fruit, extracted, and taken in either wine or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
vinegar. Indeed, what known fruit is there that is more wholesome as
an aliment than this? There is none, in fact, that has a less powerful
smell, or a greater abundance of juice, though it has a tendency to create
thirst. The leaves of it, beaten up and applied topically, arrest haemorrhage:
the kernels, mixed with oil and vinegar, are used as a liniment for
head-ache."</p>

<p>One other consideration, and we are done with Pliny. In Chapter
13, quoted on page 28, we are told that the peach "has been only introduced
of late years." This can hardly mean during the day of the author.
The peach had probably been cultivated in ancient Rome for a considerable
length of time before Pliny wrote. Vergil and Columella had mentioned
it as a planted plant; Pliny, himself, speaks of the "popularia"
as being grown "everywhere;" and the facts that it was a common article
of food and used in medicine argue an earlier date of introduction than
we might be lead to suppose from Pliny's statement "introduced of late
years." Indeed, knowing the great length of time it takes in our days of
rapid transportation and quick diffusion of knowledge to accustom ourselves
to new food-plants and to persuade agriculturists to grow them,
we should say that the peach must have been grown in Rome at least two
or three centuries to have become so well known as it seems to have been
in Pliny's time. The chief point established by these quotations is that
the peach was well established in Italy at the beginning of the Christian
era.</p>

<p>After leaving Pliny there is a boundless, uncharted waste before we
find another landmark in the history of the peach. In all matters relating
to agriculture and natural history Roman writers for several centuries
but copied the men from whom we have quoted and it was not until the
Sixteenth Century that we have any substantial account of the further
progress of this fruit. During this century, curiously enough, about the
only books on botany and horticulture were commentaries on Dioscorides,
the Greek botanist, who lived and made his reputation in Christ's time
and who for 1600 years thereafter was the sole authority on botany. Of
the ten or twelve commentaries, that of Matthiolus is most replete with
information on the fruits of the times and especially in the matter of
varieties, which he describes in greater detail than any other man since
Pliny. It must be remembered that at this time, the closing years of the
Middle Ages, there was a great awakening in agriculture and horticulture
in southern and western Europe. As the second descriptive list of peaches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
we might well quote what Matthiolus wrote, but, as in Pliny, few of his
varieties can be made out, and Gerarde, writing later in English, amplifies
the Latin author so well that we shall wait for his account.</p>

<p><i>The peach in France.</i>&mdash;Peach-culture in France probably began about
as early as in Italy, for both Columella and Pliny, as we have seen, mention
the peaches of Gaul with those of Rome. Introduced thus early, finding
suitable soil and climate and easily propagated, so delicious a fruit as
the peach must at once have become a prime favorite in the orchards of
the monasteries, where, tended by monks who were the most skilled horticulturists
of the times, the peach was disseminated throughout France
with the spread of Christianity. France was the foster-mother of the
peach in Europe&mdash;from her nurseries the Belgians, Dutch, Germans and
English had their first peach-trees. The history of the peach in France,
then, is an important chapter in the history of this fruit.</p>

<p>André Leroy, author of the great French work, <i>Dictionnaire de
Pomologie</i>, gives in considerable detail the history of the peach in France
and from him we briefly summarize the material he has brought together
in regard to this fruit up to 1600 after which our purposes are best met
by quoting directly from the originals.</p>

<p>According to Leroy<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> only peaches with a downy skin and soft flesh
which adhered to the stone came from Asia&mdash;all others, in his belief,
originated in southern France. That any peach came originally from
France we do not agree, for reasons given on a foregoing page. Leaving
the statements of origin in dispute, the first records of peaches in France
are to be found in the quotations from Columella and Pliny which we
have already discussed. Leroy mentions as the second record a reference
to the peach by Bishop Fortunat of Portiers in 530; a third from the fourteenth
Abbot of the monastery of Saint-Denis near Paris in the year 784;
while the great Charlemagne, who in 800 mentions "peaches of different
kinds," furnishes the fourth of Leroy's early records; the fifth account is
taken from the letters of Lupus, Abbot of Ferrieres, near Amiens, who
sent several varieties of peaches to a brother with instructions as to how
to plant the pits, the approximate date being 860.</p>

<p>After these Leroy gives several references to show that the peach was
commonly cultivated from the Ninth Century on but none of the writers
whom he quotes gives a recognizable picture of the kinds of peaches in
their day until we come to the epoch-making agricultural book of Olivier
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
de Serres, who, in his <i>Théatre de Agriculture</i>, published in 1604, names and
describes twelve kinds of peaches. While these descriptions are so incomplete
as to be most tantalizing to one trying to recognize varieties, yet
Olivier de Serres is one of the outstanding historians of agriculture and his
few paragraphs on the peach constitute a prominent landmark in the
history of this fruit because he names a considerable number of sorts and
makes it plain that the peach is no longer grown as a species but that
varieties are receiving recognition, though, sorry to say, we cannot be sure
from the fragmentary description whether or not any of his kinds have come
down to our time.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the Seventeenth Century the history of the
peach in France is common property to students of pomology. Botanists
and agriculturists by this time had begun to break away from Dioscorides,
Pliny and the other ancients of Greece and Rome; and in France, Germany
and England one herbal after another was beginning to appear in nearly
all of which the peach received attention. Perhaps, since France plays
so important a part in the development of the peach, a brief recapitulation
from French pomological authorities following Olivier de Serres, showing
the increase in varieties of this fruit and bringing to mind the men who
have written in pomology, may be of interest and profit.</p>

<p>Lectier, agent of the King at Orleans, in a catalog of an orchard in his
charge, published a list of 27 varieties of peaches in 1628. Thirty-nine
years later, 1667, Merlet in his <i>Abrégé des bons fruits</i> names 38 sorts of
this fruit. For the next hundred years the increase in number seems to
have been small, for in 1768 Duhamel du Monceau in <i>Traité des arbres
fruitiers</i>, the first great pomological work to be published, describes but
43 peaches. This century, however, was one in which peach-culture
increased enormously throughout France. At the beginning of the period
peaches began to be grown in the shelter of walls&mdash;a method the results
of which greatly increased the culture of this fruit. Calvel, in 1805, names
60 varieties; Louis Noisette, 1839, lists 60 sorts; André Leroy, 1852, names
but 41 varieties, but in an edition of the same work in 1865, describes 148
peaches; lastly, O. Thomas in <i>Guide pratique</i> (1876) publishes a list of
355 peaches.</p>

<p><i>The peach in Belgium, Holland, Germany and Spain.</i>&mdash;In the search
for prominent events in the development of the peach, we are absolved from
the task of tracing in detail the history of this fruit in the countries named
in the heading of this paragraph. These nations have furnished no landmarks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
in the history of the peach. France has provided all with their
varieties of this fruit. Indeed, in none, unless perhaps it be Spain, does
the peach find a congenial climate and certainly in none is the crop of any
considerable commercial value. Amateurs, too, in all but Spain at least,
give their attention to its orchard-associates rather than to the peach.
It is true, as we shall see, that the peach first came to America from Spain
and a considerable number of our varieties are now grouped in what is
called the "Spanish race." But horticulture in Spain, from the few
accounts to be had, is primitive in the extreme&mdash;there are no Spanish
pomologies and one cannot conceive that this country has aided appreciably
in the development of the peach.</p>

<p>It is possible&mdash;would that we could know the facts&mdash;that Spain
may have played an important part in introducing peaches into Europe.
For the earliest Spanish gardens were the work of the Moors and since
Moorish gardens, wonderful in beauty of design, show a strong resemblance
to the gardens of Persia, what more probable than that the Moor, half-Asiatic,
early brought the peach from Persia to Spain.</p>

<p><i>The peach in England.</i>&mdash;The peach and the gooseberry do not thrive
side by side. England grows the gooseberry to highest perfection, fogs,
rains and cloudy weather seemingly ministering to its wants. But the
peach loves sun, heat and clear skies and if these come not naturally the
peach-tree must be artificially grown. The peach is not, after centuries
of cultivation, acclimatized in England. But in all times, and of all people,
the English have been most fond of gardens and orchards and so beautiful
and delectable a fruit as the peach could not escape their attention. And
so, though under the necessity of growing this fruit on walls or under glass,
England, since the Middle Ages, has done much toward the development
of the peach, the difficulties of culture seeming to stimulate interest. Her
pomological literature is particularly rich in references to this fruit. We
in America, too, are greatly indebted to England for many varieties of
peaches. The history of the peach in England, then, should afford much
interesting and profitable material in this discussion.</p>

<p>There seems to be no record of the Romans having brought the peach
to England, yet there can be little doubt that they did so. The remains
in England of Roman houses, baths, roads, pavements and bridges, very
similar if not quite so well built as those of Italy, suggest that there were
Roman gardens about these early houses and villas in England just as
there were about those in the great Empire on the Mediterranean. Moreover,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
there was an early Saxon name for the peach. The Latin is
"Persica;" the early Anglo-Saxon is "Persoc treou;" the English,
"peach."<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> But gardening in England for most part went as it came,
with the Romans, and, during nearly a thousand years of struggling with
barbarians after the fall of the Roman Empire, the peach, in common with
all other garden-plants needing culture, seems to have disappeared and
was not reintroduced until in the Thirteenth Century.</p>

<p>That the peach came to England, as a permanent asset, from France,
is so certain from the general history of English horticulture, though there
be no authentic record to substantiate the statement, that we need consider
no alternative. One looks in vain for a satisfactory date for the
beginning of peach-culture in England. In France the monastic orders,
as we have seen, were the conservators of horticulture, as they were of all
arts excepting war, and we feel sure that, as the Church reached England,
some good bishop, father or brother planted peaches in a monastery garden.
Yet our quest of a date is rewarded with nothing earlier than 1216, in which
year, according to the Chronicle of Roger of Wendover,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> "King John, at
Newark, in the midst of his despair and disappointment, hastened his
end by a surfeit of peaches and ale." From this we may certainly say
that peach-culture was established in England at least as early as the
beginning of the Thirteenth Century.</p>

<p>Two hundred years elapse before we find another reference to the
peach in England. Lydgate, English monk and poet (1375-1440?), as
quoted by the Hon. Mrs. Evelyn Cecil,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> mentioned peaches among "the
fruits which more common be." Possibly an earlier reference is found in
Chaucer's <i>Romaunt of the Rose</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And many hoomely trees there were</span>
<span class="i0">That peches, coynes, and apples bere."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>English fruit-books commonly accredit the introduction of the peach
in England to a certain Wolf, gardener to Henry VIII, and fix the date at
about 1524, but the quotations given show that this fruit was probably
well established long before the Sixteenth Century. Perhaps it suffices
to say that the peach began to be cultivated in England at the close of the
Middle Ages&mdash;a time sufficiently vague to be convenient in the state of
inexactness of our knowledge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>In the Sixteenth Century references to the peach become so numerous
that one cannot reckon with all of them. Selecting only a few notable
names of writers on plants, we have Turner, one of the first and perhaps
the greatest of British herbalists, who mentions the peach in his <i>Herball</i>
of 1551, though rather disparagingly, for he says: "The peche is no great
tre in England that I could se&mdash;the apples are soft flesshy when they are
rype, something hory without." Tusser, author of <i>Five Hundred Points
of Good Husbandrie</i>, 1573, the best-known work on farming of the times,
gives a list of fruits to be transplanted in January among which are
"Peaches, white and red." Lastly, the century ends with John Gerarde's
<i>The Herball or Generall Historie of Plantes</i>, 1597, in which the peach is
treated at greater length and to better advantage than by any previous
English author. An improved edition of Gerarde's herbal was brought
out in 1633 by Thomas Johnson who adds very materially to the discussion
of the peach in the first edition and from this we quote in full all that
pertains to varieties:<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>"There are divers sorts of Peaches besides the foure here set forth
by our Author, but the trees do not much differ in shape, but the difference
chiefly consists in the fruit, whereof I will give you the names of the choice
ones, and such as are to be had from my friend Mr. Miller in Old-street,
which are these; two sorts of Nutmeg Peaches; The Queenes Peach; the
Newington Peach; The grand Carnation Peach; The Carnation Peach;
The blacke Peach; The Melocotone; The White; The Romane; The
Alberza; The Island Peach; Peach du Troy. These are all good ones. He
hath also of that kinde of Peach which some call <i>Nucipersica</i> or Nectorins,
these following kindes; the Roman red, the best of fruits; the bastard
Red; the little dainty greene; the Yellow, the White; the Russet, which is
not so good as the rest. Those that would see any fuller discourse of these
may have recourse to the late work of Mr. John Parkinson, where they
may find more varieties, and more largely handled, and therefore not
necessary for me in this place to insist upon them.</p>

<p>1. The Peach tree is a tree of no great bignesse: it sendeth forth
divers boughes, which be so brittle, as oftentimes they are broken with
the weight of the fruit or with the winde. The leaves be long, nicked in
the edges, like almost to those of the Walnut tree, and in taste bitter:
the floures be of a light purple colour. The fruit of Peaches be round, and
have as it were a chinke or cleft on the one side; they are covered with a
soft and thin downe or hairy cotton, being white without, and of a pleasant
taste; in the middle whereof is a rough or rugged stone, wherein is contained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
a kernell like unto the Almond; the meate about the stone is of a white color.
The root is tough and yellowish.</p>

<p>2. The red Peach tree is likewise a tree of no great bignesse; it
also sendeth forth divers boughes or branches which be very brittle. The
leaves be long, and nicked in the edges like to the precedent. The floures
be also like unto the former; the fruit or Peaches be round, and of a red
colour on the outside; the meate likewise about the stone is of a gallant
red colour. These kindes of Peaches are very like to wine in taste, and
therefore marvellous pleasant.</p>

<p>3. <i>Persica praecocia</i>, or the d'avant Peach tree is like unto the
former, but his leaves are greater and larger. The fruit or Peaches be of
a russet colour on the one side, and on the other side next unto the Sun of
a red colour, but much greater than the red Peach: the stones whereof
are like unto the former: the pulpe or meate within is of a golden yellow
colour, and of a pleasant taste.</p>

<p>4. <i>Persica lutea</i>, or the yellow Peach tree is like unto the former in
leaves and flours, his fruit is of a yellow color on the out side, and likewise
on the in side, harder than the rest: in the middle of the Peach is a wooddy
hard and rough stone full of crests and gutters, in which doth ly a kernel
much like to that of the almond, and with such a like skin: the substance
within is white, and of taste somewhat bitter. The fruit hereof is of
greatest pleasure, and of best taste of all the other of his kinde; although
there be found at this day divers other sorts that are of very good taste,
not remembered of the ancient, or set down by the later Writers, whereof
to speake particularly would not bee great to our pretended purpose, considering
wee hasten to an end.</p>

<p>5. There is also kept in some of our choice gardens a kind of Peach
which hath a very double and beautifull floure, but it is seldom succeeded
by any fruit: they call this <i>Persica flore pleno</i>, The double blossomed
Peach."</p>

<p>In the first edition Gerarde describes but four peaches, but Johnson,
36 years later, says "there are divers sorts besides the foure here set forth
by our Author" and then names thirteen "choice ones, such as are to be
had from my friend Miller in Old-street," who "hath also" six varieties
"of that kinde of Peach which some call <i>Nucipersia</i> or <i>Nectorins</i>." Either
Gerarde neglects the peach or varieties increased greatly in 36 years&mdash;probably
the former. We have not found the nectarine mentioned before
Johnson's revision of Gerarde in 1633 and probably this fruit was not well
known in England long before, for Parkinson, discussing them in 1629,
says "they have been with us not many years." This brings us to Parkinson's
list of peaches, which contains, as Johnson says, a "fuller discourse,"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
than Gerarde. John Parkinson (1567-1650), another British herbalist,
who also cultivated a famous garden in London, devotes a chapter to
the peach and another to the nectarine. These being short, and every
word pertinent, we publish them in full:<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>"The great white Peach is white on the outside as the meate is also,
and is a good well rellished fruit.</p>

<p>The small white Peach is all one with the greater, but differeth in
size.</p>

<p>The Carnation Peach is of three sorts, two are round, and the third
long; they are all of a whitish colour, shadowed over with red, and more
red on the side is next the sunne: the lesser round is the more common,
and the later ripe.</p>

<p>The grand Carnation Peach is like the former round Peach, but
greater, and is as late ripe, that is, in the beginning of September.</p>

<p>The red Peach is an exceeding well rellished fruit.</p>

<p>The russet Peach is one of the most ordinary Peaches in the Kingdome,
being of a russet colour on the outside, and but of a reasonable rellish,
farre meaner then many other.</p>

<p>The Island Peach is a faire Peach, and of a very good rellish.</p>

<p>The Newington Peach is a very good Peach, and of an excellent
good rellish, being of a whitish greene colour on the outside, yet halfe
reddish, and is ripe about Bartholmew tide.</p>

<p>The yellow Peach is of a deepe yellow colour; there be hereof divers
sorts, some good and some bad.</p>

<p>The St. James Peach is the same with the Queenes Peach, here
belowe set downe, although some would make them differing.</p>

<p>The Melocotone Peach is a yellow faire Peach, but differing from
the former yellow both in forme and taste, in that this hath a small crooked
end or point for the most part, it is ripe before them, and better rellished
then any of them.</p>

<p>The Peach <i>du Troas</i> is a long and great whitish yellow Peach, red
on the outside, early ripe, and is another kinde of Nutmeg Peach.</p>

<p>The Queenes Peach is a faire great yellowish browne Peach, shadowed
as it were over with deepe red, and is ripe at Bartholmew tide, of a very
pleasant good taste.</p>

<p>The Romane Peach is a very good Peach, and well rellished.</p>

<p>The Durasme or Spanish Peach is of a darke yellowish red colour
on the outside, and white within.</p>

<p>The blacke Peach is a great large Peach, of a very darke browne colour
on the outside, it is of a waterish taste, and late ripe.</p>

<p>The Alberza Peach is late ripe, and of a reasonable good taste.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>The Almond Peach, so called, because the kernell of the stone is
sweete, like the Almond, and the fruit also somewhat pointed like the
Almond in the huske; it is early ripe, and like the Newington Peach, but
lesser.</p>

<p>The Man Peach is of two sorts, the one longer then the other, both
of them are good Peaches, but the shorter is the better rellished.</p>

<p>The Cherry Peach is a small Peach, but well tasted.</p>

<p>The Nutmeg Peach is of two sorts, one that will be hard when it is
ripe, and eateth not so pleasantly as the other, which will bee soft and
mellow; they are both small Peaches, having very little or no resemblance
at all to a Nutmeg, except in being a little longer than round, and are early
ripe."</p>

<p>"Many other sorts of Peaches there are, whereunto wee can give no
especial name; and therefore I passe them over in silence."</p>

<p>Agriculture seems to have received a great impetus in England about
the middle of the Seventeenth Century, possibly with the beginning of
Cromwell's Protectorate in 1653. Toward the end of the century the
momentum began to carry pomology with it, the most apparent results
of the movement at this distance, as it affects the peach, being a great
output of new varieties and of fruit-books in which the new offerings were
described. From this time the progress of peach-culture in England
assumed so great proportions that space does not permit following it
further in this brief account&mdash;a task unnecessary, too, for the pomological
works of Lawrence, Switzer, Langley, Brookshaw, Miller, Rea, Hitt,
Abercrombie and Forsyth, to select the most prominent names, cover the
century well and are still accessible in large libraries. Moreover, by this
time the peach was well established in America and we must take up its
history there.</p>

<h3>THE PEACH IN AMERICA</h3>

<p>One of the first fruits of the heroic age of Spanish discovery in America
was the naturalization in the New World of animals and plants which the
discoverers brought with them. Most notable of these are the wild horses
of the western plains and the Indian peaches of southern forests. Long
before the English, Dutch, French or Swedes planted colonies in America,
peaches, introduced by Spaniards, were common property of the Indians
in southeastern and southwestern America. The Spaniards came to the
New World to conquer and brought swords more often than fruits, but a
cheery note in the long dirge of human woes suffered by the Aztecs is found
in the rapid dissemination of the peach, among other domesticated plants,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
at an early period in Mexico. Which of the Spanish conquerors brought
the peach or when it came does not appear but we have record that less
than fifty years after Cortez conquered the country the peach was, apparently,
commonly grown in Mexico. The beginnings of peach-culture on
this continent are, then, to be sought in the region south of the Rio Grande.</p>

<p><i>The peach in Mexico.</i>&mdash;Authority for the statement that the peach
was cultivated in Mexico less than fifty years after the Spanish conquest
is found in a Spanish book published by Molina in 1571, in which three
peaches are described in Hispano-Aztec compound words as follows:
"<i>xuchipal durazno</i>, 'red-colored peach,' <i>cuztic durazno</i>, 'yellow peach,'
and <i>xocotlmelocoton</i>, 'peach fruit.'"<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> That the peach is to be found
everywhere in Mexico, cultivated and as an escape from cultivation, where
climate permits is common knowledge to pomologists, explorers having
from time to time brought to light sorts worthy of introduction in our
southern states, and frequent mention is made of this fruit by visitors to
that country.</p>

<p>These Mexican peaches become of special interest to American fruit-growers
because they constitute, with the offspring of early introductions
in Florida, what pomologists call the "Spanish Race" of this fruit.
"American Race" is a more fitting name, for these peaches are an
American product. Four centuries of reproduction from seed, in a climate
and soil different from any previously imposed upon them, and abnormally
short generations have given to this continent a group of peaches with
many characters in common.</p>

<p>Tracing further the history of the peaches that early came to Mexico,
we find evidence that in a comparatively short time they had been taken
northward into New Mexico, Arizona and the Californias. It is barely
possible that from the same source the peach was eventually carried as far
eastward as the Mississippi, for early explorers found naturalized peaches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
in the valley of this great river. No doubt the Jesuit and Franciscan
fathers, chief representatives of the Roman Catholic Church in the early
settlement of Mexico and southwestern America, early carried the peach
from place to place, for, as advance guards of civilization, these men usually
planted fruits, grains, vegetables and flowers at the missions they founded.
Therefore, it is hardly too much to say that the history of the peach in the
southwest follows the establishment, one after another, of the old missions,
beginning in America with the settlement of Sante Fe in 1605 and continuing
until Spanish rule passed into that of the United States.</p>

<p>That the padres of the early religious orders planted gardens and
orchards as they planted the cross of Christianity among the Indian tribes
in the southwest may be seen from such accounts of the mission as the
following, written by a Spanish officer traveling in what is now New Mexico
in 1799:<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> "The Moquinos are the most industrious of the many Indian
nations that inhabit and have been discovered in that portion of America.
They till the earth with great care, and apply to all their fields the manures
proper for each crop. The same cereals and pulse are raised by them,
that are everywhere produced by the civilized population in our provinces.
They are attentive to their kitchen gardens, and have all the varieties of
fruit-bearing trees it has been in their power to procure. The peach tree
yields abundantly."</p>

<p>The antiquity of peach-culture among southern Indians, from Mexico
to Florida, is shown by the fact that, among the prominent tribes of this
region, there is a distinct name for the peach but the names of other introduced
fruits, and of some native ones, are derived from that of the peach.
Thus, according to W. R. Gerard,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> who gave careful study to Indian names
of plants in at least four Indian languages, the name of the peach is the
radical while that of several plums is the equivalent of "little peach,"
"deer's peach" and "barren peach" while the cultivated apples and
pears were by some Indians called "big peach."</p>

<p>As these Indian peaches have cut a prominent figure in furnishing
stocks for American peach-orchards, are the source from which came a
number of varieties, and, more than all else, gave inspiration for planting
permanent orchards of this fruit on American soil, we may well consider
them at greater length.</p>

<p><i>Indian peaches.</i>&mdash;In many parts of the South, from the Ohio to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
Gulf and from the Atlantic to the Great Plains, the peach is naturalized
and has run into many varieties of a peculiar and well-recognized type.
This is the "Indian Peach" of this vast region, the chief distinguishing
characters of which are: Trees with long, spreading limbs; young growth
with purplish bark; small, flat, comparatively persistent leaves; blossoms
large; season sometimes covering several weeks; fruit small, streaked with
red beneath the skin, giving it a striped appearance, heavily pubescent;
flesh usually yellow; ripening very late, season long, and of poor or indifferent
quality. The trees of these Indian peaches have a smack of wildness
which the best of pruning does not wholly subdue. The aborigines
undoubtedly obtained peaches from Spaniards settling in both Mexico and
Florida. The first source we have discussed. We come now to the
second.</p>

<p>No doubt the Spaniards planted peaches in their first settlement of
Florida at Saint Augustine in 1565. We have no record of the fact but
early Indian traders found the natives of northern Florida and the neighboring
states growing peaches in and about their villages in such quantity and
with such familiarity as to suggest that the several tribes had long known
this fruit. Hilton, an Englishman, who visited Florida a hundred years
after the Spaniards established themselves at Saint Augustine, records that:
"the country abounds with grapes, large figs and peaches."<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> The
besetting sins of our early explorers were hasty generalization and exaggeration,
and since the Indian peach, in what is now Florida at any rate,
does not "abound" we must believe that Hilton was either farther north or
was dissembling. Of the abundance of Indian peaches in the other Gulf
States, there can be no doubt, for John Bartram, America's first great
botanist, a man of note among all American naturalists, in the account
of his travels through this region in 1765-1766 frequently mentions the
peach as wild or as having been cultivated by the Indians.</p>

<p>Thus, Bartram says, speaking of the Cherokee town of Sticoe, on or
near the Savannah River:<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> "On these towering hills appeared the ruins
of the ancient famous town of Sticoe. Here was a vast Indian mount or
tumulus and great terrace, on which stood the council-house, with banks
encompassing their circus; here were also old Peach and Plumb orchards;
some of the trees appeared yet thriving and fruitful." And again, discussing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the ruins of a French town near Mobile, Alabama, he says:<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> "I
ascended the bank of the river, and penetrating the groves, came presently
to old fields, where I observed ruins of ancient habitations, there being
abundance of Peach and Fig trees, loaded with fruit, which affording a
very acceptable dessert after the heats and toil of the day, and evening
drawing on apace, I concluded to take up my quarters here for the night."
And still again, he found on Pearl Island:<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> "Besides the native forest trees
and shrubs already noted, manured fruit trees arrive in this island to the
utmost degree of perfection, as Pears, Peaches, Figs, Grape Vines,
Plumbs, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Bartram in his travels found the peach so widely and abundantly
naturalized that he was inclined to believe America to be its habitat.
At least Kalm,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> the Swedish naturalist, who visited Bartram in 1748-1749
reports that Bartram "looked upon peaches as an original American
fruit, and as growing wild in the greater part of America."</p>

<p>In 1758 Le Page Du Pratz, who lived on a plantation in Louisiana for
several years and wrote a history of the French colony, says that the natives
had peaches and figs when the French settled in Louisiana in 1698. He
probably errs, however, in stating that the natives got their trees from the
English colony of Carolina since the English did not settle in Carolina
until 1670. No doubt the Indians had long before had peaches and figs
from the Spaniards of Florida or Mexico. The account which this historian
gives of early peach-culture in Louisiana is worth printing in full:<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> "The
natives had doubtless got the peach trees and fig trees from the English
colony of Carolina, before the French established themselves in Louisiana.
The peaches are of the kind which we call alberges; are of the size of the
fist, adhere to the stone, and contain so much water that they make a kind
of wine of it. The figs are either blue or white; are large and well enough
tasted. Our colonists plant the peach stones about the end of February,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
and suffer the trees to grow exposed to all weathers. In the third year
they will gather from one tree at least two hundred peaches, and double
that number for six or seven years more, when the tree dies irrecoverably.
As new trees are so easily produced, the loss of the old ones is not in the
least regretted."</p>

<p>There are many indirect references to peaches in the Mississippi
Valley most of which can be traced to Father Hennepin's account of peaches
in Louisiana. He says:<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> "The peaches there are like those of Europe
and bear very good fruit in such abundance that the savages are often
obliged to prop up the trees with forked sticks." It turns out, however,
that Father Hennepin was the Baron Munchausen of the early French
explorers, it being doubtful whether he was ever farther down the Mississippi
than the mouth of the Illinois. Probably, therefore, we must put
much of what early writers say of the great abundance of peaches in this
region to the soaring imagination of this early religious explorer. Yet
these reports are credited by so careful a man as Kalm, who writes:<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> "I
have been told by all those who have made journies to the southern parts
of Canada, and to the river Mississippi, that the woods there abound with
peach-trees, which bear excellent fruit, and that the Indians of those parts
say that those trees have been there since times immemorial."</p>

<p>A little later we have reliable information that the peach was
naturalized in parts of the Mississippi Valley at least, for Thomas Nuttall,
leading botanist of his time and a thoroughly reliable reporter, traveling
in Arkansas in 1819, writes:<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> "The thermometer towards noon rises to
seventy degrees and the peach and plum trees, almost equally naturalized,
have nearly finished blooming." And, again,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> "The peach of Persia is
already naturalized throughout the forests of Arkansa." From this we
may picture wild peaches as having grown for generations in parts of
Arkansas and, no doubt, of the now famous Ozark region, where, we are
told, peach-trees in abundance now decorate, with flower and fruit, primeval
forests.</p>

<p>Reserving the best description of Indian peaches to the last we now
turn from Arkansas to the Carolinas. Here, in 1700, John Lawson, a
surveyor, who in his work had ample opportunity to know the country,
wrote about the wild and cultivated plants of the region. Lawson, although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
not a trained naturalist, was a keen observer, a lover of nature and much
interested in the agricultural development of the Carolinas. Moreover,
he writes so simply, directly, and in a tone so temperate, in contrast to the
declamatory style of the times, that one accepts without question what
he says. We feel we are justified in quoting at some length Lawson's
description of Indian peaches:<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>"All peaches with us are standing; neither have we any wall fruit
in Carolina, for we have heat enough, and therefore do not require it. We
have a great many sorts of this fruit, which all thrive to admiration, peach
trees coming to perfection, with us, as easily as the weeds. A peach falling
to the ground brings a peach tree that shall bear in three years, or sometimes
sooner. Eating peaches in our orchards makes them come up so
thick from the kernel, that we are forced to take a great deal of care to
weed them out, otherwise they make our land a wilderness of peach trees.
They generally bear so full that they break great part of their limbs down.
We have likewise very fair nectarines, especially the red, that clings to
the stone; the other yellow fruit, that leaves the stone. Of the last I have
a tree that most years brings me fifteen or twenty bushels. I see no
foreign fruit like this, for thriving in all sorts of land, and bearing its fruit
to admiration. I want to be satisfied about one sort of this fruit, which the
Indians claim as their own, and affirm they had it growing amongst them
before any Europeans came to America.</p>

<p>The fruit I will describe as exactly as I can. The tree grows very
large, most commonly as big as a handsome apple tree; the flowers are of
a reddish, murrey color, the fruit is rather more downy than the yellow
peach, and commonly very large and soft, being very full of juice. They
part freely from the stone, and the stone is much thicker than all the other
peach stones we have, which seems to me that it is a spontaneous fruit of
America; yet in those parts of America that we inhabit, I never could hear
that any peach trees were ever found growing in the woods; neither have the
foreign Indians, that live remote from the English, any other sort. And
those living amongst us have a hundred of this sort for one other. They
are a hardy fruit, and are seldom damaged by the north-east blast, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
others are. Of this sort we make vinegar; wherefore we call them vinegar
peaches, and sometimes Indian peaches.</p>

<p>This tree grows to a vast bigness, exceeding most apple trees. They
bear well, though sometimes an early spring comes on in February, and
perhaps when the tree is fully blown, the cloudy, north-east winds, which
attend the end of that month, or the beginning of March, destroy most
of the fruit. The biggest apricot tree I ever saw, as they told me, was
grafted on a peach stock in the ground. I know of no other sort with us,
than the common. We generally raise this fruit from the stone, which
never fails to bring the same fruit. Likewise our peach stones effect the
same, without so much as once missing to produce the same sort that the
stone came from."</p>

<p><i>Peaches in the colonies.</i>&mdash;The first peaches in the American colonies
must have been planted at Jamestown for, in 1629, Captain John Smith
writes of "peaches in abundance."<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> The trees, however, seem to have been
neglected for, continuing, Smith says: "Apples, Peares, Apricocks, Vines,
figges, and other fruits some have planted, that prospered exceedingly;
but their diligence about Tobacco left them to be spoiled by the cattell;
yet now they beginne to revive." The settlement in Virginia at that time,
so soon after the Indian massacres, was small and there could have been
but few trees so that Smith's "abundance" was but as a grain of sand on
the seashore with the many thousands of bushels required to make an
abundance at the present time.</p>

<p>Despite the neglect of fruit to attend to tobacco which Smith
laments, the planting of orchards must have gone on apace, for in 1633 a
Dutch sea-captain named De Vries visiting Virginia describes the Menife
plantation, famous in the colony at that time, as having a garden containing
rosemary, sage, marjoram and thyme, the apple, pear and cherry
while the house itself was surrounded by peach-trees.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Three years later,
1642, Berkeley became governor of the colony and we are told that about
his house at Green Spring there were fifteen hundred apple, peach, apricot,
quince and other fruit-trees.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> Robert Evelyn, writing forty years after
the settlement of Jamestown says: "Peaches better than Apricocks by
some doe feed hogs, one man hath ten thousand trees."<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>Fruit-growing in colonial Virginia was not without promoters and one,
a Colonel Norwood, had the persuasive eloquence of the barkers for get-rich-quick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
orchard-planting concerns of our own times. Colonel Norwood,
an Englishman, visited Virginia in 1649 and on his return wrote:<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
"Oranges, Lemons, Pine-aples, Plantanes, Peaches, Apricocks, Peares,
Apels, in a word all sort of excellent Fruits will grow there in full perfection:
you may sleepe whilst they are growing, after their setting or engrafting,
there needes no more labour but your prayers, that they may prosper, and
now and then an eye to prevent their casualties, wounds or diseases."
No doubt Norwood is over enthusiastic in his praises and yet it is true
that there were few pests of the peach at this time, most of these coming,
one by one, with the development of the fruit-industry. About all that
any fruit needed at this time was, to use a modern political phase, "watchful
waiting."</p>

<p>Considering the agricultural efforts that must have been required to
produce tobacco, then the medium of exchange at home and abroad, and
of corn, which in Virginia was the staff of life, one wonders that fruit
received the attention indicated by the following account written in 1656
of a still earlier period:<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> "The Country is full of gallant Orchards, and
the fruit generally more luscious and delightful than here, witnesse the
Peach and Quince, the latter may be eaten raw savourily, the former
differs as much exceeds ours as the best relished apple we have doth the
crabb, and of both most excellent and comfortable drinks are made."
Perhaps the explanation of the popularity of fruits in Virginia is to be
found in the statement that from fruits are made "most excellent and
comfortable drinks." On the word of Captain John Smith we have it
that "few of the upper-class planters drink any water."<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> Wine was not
made in quantity in the colonies and liquors distilled from grains were
not known so that thirst, in this case the mother of invention, caused
the colonists to turn to peaches and apples for strong drink.</p>

<p>Prohibition was not preached in the colonies nor in the states until
long after the Revolution and King Alcohol dominated every part of the
New World. Distilling spirituous liquors from rye and corn seems not
to have been practiced, if the art were known, until the beginning of the
Nineteenth Century. The upper classes drank wine, but cider, perry,
peach-vinegar and similar fermented fruit-juices were in common use by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
the middle and lower classes while the carousing population of the whole
country, and there seems to have been many liberal tipplers, slaked their
thirst with rum, apple-jack and peach-brandy. So much on drinking,
not to point a moral or adorn a tale, but to bring out the fact that fruit-growing
in America had its beginning and for two hundred years had
almost its whole sustenance in the demand for strong drink. This is shown
in almost every page of the horticultural literature of the times and in the
laws of the colonies restricting prices and levying taxes on liquors made
from fruits. Peaches were grown in quantities wherever they could be
made to succeed in the colonies, not for the fruit itself, but for the making
of peach-vinegar, a sort of cider, and peach-brandy, a distilled liquor.</p>

<p>By the end of the first hundred years in America the English seem to
have brought orcharding to a fine state of perfection in Virginia, the peach
succeeding then, by all accounts, rather better than now. Bruce<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> gives
an admirable summing-up of orchard-conditions at the end of the period
named: "In the closing years of the seventeenth century, there were
few plantations in Virginia which did not possess orchards of apple and
peach trees, pear, plum, apricot, and quince. The number of trees was
often very large. The orchard of Robert Hide of York contained three
hundred peach and three hundred apple trees. There were twenty-five
hundred apple trees in the orchard of Colonel Fitzhugh. Each species of
fruit was represented by many varieties; thus, of the apple, there were
mains, pippins, russentens, costards, marigolds, kings, magitens and
batchelors; of the pear, bergamy and warden. The quince was greater in
size, but less aciduated than the English quince; on the other hand, the
apricot and plum were inferior in quality to the English, not ripening in
the same perfection. Cherries grew in notable abundance. So great was
the productive capacity of the peach that some of the landowners planted
orchards of the tree for the mere purpose of using the fruit to fatten their
hogs; on some plantations, as many as forty bushels are said to have been
knocked down to the swine in the course of a single season."</p>

<p>Treasure after treasure of experience and narrative may be found in
tracing the history of the peach in Virginia but space permits only the
references that best illuminate the development and culture of this fruit
in America. Two accounts must serve to give an idea of the peach in
Virginia in the Eighteenth Century. Robert Beverly, in his <i>History of
Virginia</i> gives a good idea of the culture, kinds and uses of peaches in the
early part of the Eighteenth Century:<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> "Peaches, nectarines and apricots,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
as well as plumbs and cherries, grow there upon standard trees. They
commonly bear in three years from the stone, and thrive so exceedingly,
that they seem to have no need of grafting or inoculating, if any body would
be so good a husband; and truly I never heard of any that did graft either
plum, nectarine, peach or apricot in that country, before the first edition
of this book."</p>

<p>"Peaches and nectarines I believe to be spontaneous, somewhere or
other on that continent, for the Indians have, and ever had greater variety,
and finer sorts of them than the English. The best sort of these cling
to the stone, and will not come off clear, which they call plum nectarines,
and plum peaches or clint stones. Some of these are twelve or thirteen
inches in the girt. These sorts of fruits are raised so easily there, that
some good husbands plant great orchards of them, purposely for their
hogs; and others make a drink of them, which they call mobby, and either
drink it as cider, or distill it off for brandy. This makes the best spirit next
to grapes."</p>

<p>The text for the only other account we have space to publish for the
period under consideration is found in Washington's diary for February 22,
1760. "Laid in part, the Worm of a fence around the Peach orchard."
The information in Washington's short statement is inconsequential but
from it we form a pleasant picture of peach-growing at Mount Vernon.
Washington owned a distillery and in another place we learn that "the
distiller made every fall a good deal of apple, peach and persimmon brandy."
To supply the needs of the plantation in fruit and brandy, there must
have been a considerable number of trees, all seedlings, but set in straight
rows, for Washington, the surveyor, would have no botch work in aligning
and spacing. The fence, the worm of which Washington was laying
on his twenty-eighth birthday, if typical of the times, was of split walnut-rails,
laid zigzag. Eventually it became trellised with wild grapes, Virginia
creepers, honeysuckles and morning-glories. The corners grew up to
sassafras, brambles and other plants of the region. In spring, we picture
then, the pink-petalled trees, in the peach-orchard at Mount Vernon,
making obeisance to the Father of his Country as he rode the rounds of
the plantation; in summer the shady shrub-grown corners of the worm-fence,
sweet-scented with honeysuckle or aromatic with sassafras, furnished
refreshing resting places as Washington watched his harvest; later, the
orchard, voluptuous with fruit, gave gustatory promises of products to eat
and drink and dazzled the eye with autumn colors of Virginia creeper, wild
grape and sassafras. The peach-orchard not only served the appetite at
Mount Vernon but was one of the most picturesque spots on the plantation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>Let the foregoing accounts of Smith, Bruce and Beverly suffice to give
status to early peach-growing in Virginia. They apply equally well to
Maryland, these neighboring colonies, it will be remembered, being called
by one of our authors, "Leah and Rachel or the Two Fruitful Sisters."
Of the peach in the states to the south at least a few words ought to be
said.</p>

<p>In the discussion of Indian peaches we have had a good account of the
early history of the peach in the Carolinas by Lawson. We now show the
status of peach-growing in this region at a later period. In an account
of South Carolina and Georgia, said to have been written by General
Oglethorpe, printed in London in 1733, we find the following:<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>"Mulberries, both black and white, are natives of this soil, and are
found in the woods, as are many other sorts of fruit trees of excellent kinds,
and the growth of them is surprisingly swift; for a peach, apricot, or
nectarine tree will, from the stone, grow to be a bearing tree in four or five
years' time."</p>

<p>"They have oranges, lemons, apples and pears, besides the peach
and apricot mentioned before. Some of these are so delicious that whoever
tastes them will despise the insipid, watery taste of those we have in
England; and yet such is the plenty of them that they are given to the hogs
in great quantities."</p>

<p>A little later, 1740, Mr. Thomas Jones of Savannah wrote to Mr. John
Lyde concerning the contents of his town-garden as follows:<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>"As to our fruit, the most common are peaches and nectarines (I
believe that I had a hundred bushels of the former this year in my little
garden in town); we have also apples of divers sorts, chincopin nuts, walnut,
chestnut, hickory, and ground nuts."</p>

<p>The third writer is Sir John Oldmixon who quotes a Mr. Archdale
in regard to the fruits of Carolina. He writes:<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>"Everything generally grows there that will grow in any part of
Europe, there being already many sorts of fruits, as apples, pears, apricots,
nectarines, etc. They that once taste of them will despise the watery,
washy taste of those in England. There's such plenty of them that they
are given to the hogs. In four or five years they come from a stone to be
bearing trees."</p>

<p>The same author is worth quoting in regard to the early culture of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
Melocoton peach in Virginia.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> "Here is such plenty of peaches that they
give them to their hogs; some of them, called malachotoons, are as big
as a lemon and resemble it a little." The history of the word melocoton,
by the way, is interesting. It comes from the Latin <i>melum cotoneum,</i>
literally, apple-quince. The corruption is of Spanish origin and in Spain
"melocoton" is a common name for the peach. The word, however,
is now common enough in English, no less than 29 variant spellings being
found in the dictionaries and every extensive list of peaches having a
number of varieties with melocoton as a prefix or an affix to the name.</p>

<p>Passing now to the northern colonies we find that the history of the
peach in Pennsylvania begins with the history of the State. William
Penn founded Philadelphia in 1682 and a year later, in describing the new
country, names the peach as one of its assets:<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> "There are also very good
peaches, and in great quantities; not an Indian plantation without them,
but whether naturally here at first, I know not. However, one may have
them by bushels for little; they make a pleasant drink; and I think not
inferior to any peach you have in England, except the true Newington."</p>

<p>It would be hard to find a part of the earth better fitted in soil and
climate for sure and abounding harvests of peaches than the Chesapeake
peach-belt extending up through Maryland and taking in Delaware, New
Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. We may be sure, then, that if the
Indians were growing peaches in the abundance described by Penn in what
is now Philadelphia, peach-orchards were not less common in all of the
Chesapeake belt. That the whole region was bountifully supplied with
this delicious fruit when settled by whites is further indicated, however,
in a letter written by Mahlon Stacy from the "Falls of the Delaware,"
New Jersey, in 1680, to his brother Revell in England. He says:<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>"I have travelled through most of the places that are settled, and
some that are not; and in every place I find the country very apt to answer
the expectation of the diligent. I have seen orchards laden with fruit
to admiration; their very limbs torn to pieces by the weight, and most
delicious to the taste and lovely to behold. I have seen an apple tree from
a pippin kernel yield a barrel of curious cider, and peaches in such plenty
that some people took their carts a peach gathering; I could not but smile
at the conceit of it; they are very delicate fruit, and hang almost like our
onions that are tied on ropes."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>We are told in Watson's Annals of Philadelphia<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> that one of the
remarkable characteristics of Germantown, Pennsylvania, in 1700 was
that the whole of the main street, one mile in length, "was fronted with
blooming peach trees."</p>

<p>An account of peaches in the Delaware region as late as the middle of
the Eighteenth Century shows that even then the peach was regarded as
indigenous "like maize and tobacco." This quotation, too, is interesting
because it gives a glimpse of cultural methods, kinds, uses and danger from
frost. The author was a Swedish clergyman, a resident of the region for
some years. He writes:<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>"Peach trees stand within an enclosure by themselves; grow even in
the stoniest places without culture. The fruit is the most delicious that
the mouth can taste, and often allowable in fevers. One kind, called
clingstones, are considered the best; in these the stones are not loose from
the fruit as in the others. Many have peach orchards chiefly for the
purpose of feeding their swine, which are not allowed to run at large. They
first bloom, in March, the flowers coming out before the leaves, and are
often injured by the frosts; they are ripe toward the close of August. This
fruit is regarded as indigenous, like maize and tobacco; for as far as any
Indians have been seen in the interior of the country these plants are
found to extend."</p>

<p>Pressed for space, we must conclude the discussion of early peach-growing
in this region by quoting an account of the industry as it existed
in 1750 when the Swedish naturalist, Kalm, visited the colonies and spent
some time in Pennsylvania and neighboring states. Writing of orchards
he says:<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> "Every countryman, even a common peasant, has commonly
an orchard near his house in which all sorts of fruit, such as peaches, apples,
pears, cherries, and others, are in plenty. The peaches were now almost
ripe. They are rare in Europe, particularly in Sweden, for in that country
hardly any people besides the rich taste them. But here every countryman
had an orchard full of peach trees, which were covered with such quantities
of fruit, that we could scarcely walk in the orchard, without treading on
those peaches which were fallen off; many of which were always left on the
ground, and only part of them was sold in town, and the rest was consumed
by the family and strangers; for every one that passed by, was at
liberty to go into the orchard, and to gather as many of them as he wanted.
Nay, this fine fruit was frequently given to the swine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>This fruit is, however, sometimes kept for winter use, and for this
purpose they are prepared in the following manner. The fruit is cut into
four parts, the stone thrown away, and the fruit put upon a thread, on which
they are exposed to the sunshine in the open air, till they are sufficiently
dry. They are then put into a vessel for winter. But this manner of
drying them is not very good, because the rain of this season very easily
spoils and putrifies them, whilst they hang in the open air. For this reason
a different method is followed by others, which is by far the most eligible.
The peaches are as before cut into four parts, are then either put upon a
thread, or laid upon a board, and so hung up in the air when the sun shines.
Being dried in some measure, or having lost their juice by this means, they
are put into an oven, out of which the bread has but just been taken, and
are left in it for a while. But they are soon taken out and brought into the
fresh air; and after that they are again put into the oven, and this is
repeated several times until they are as dry as they ought to be. For if
they were dried up at once in the oven, they would shrivel up too much,
and lose part of their flavour. They are then put up and kept for the
winter. They are either baked into tarts and pyes, or boiled and prepared
as dried apples and pears are in Sweden. Several people here dry
and preserve their apples in the same manner as their peaches.</p>

<p>The peach trees have, as I am told, been first planted here by the
Europeans. But at present they succeed very well, and require even less
care than our apple and pear trees."</p>

<p>Kalm<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> also gives an account of the colonists' method of making peach-brandy,
which, as we have seen, plays so important a part in the peach-industry
of the times. Brandy-making, according to Kalm, was simplicity
itself and it is not to be wondered that in those days of strong drink
peach-brandy was popular. The following is Kalm's description: "They
make brandy from peaches here, after the following method. The fruit
is cut asunder, and the stones are taken out. The pieces of fruit are then
put into a vessel, where they are left for three weeks or a month, till they
are quite putrid. They are then put into the distilling vessel, and the
brandy is made and afterwards distilled over again. This brandy is not
for people who have a more refined taste, but it is only for the common
kind of people, such as workmen and the like."</p>

<p>Kalm, travelling from Trenton to Princeton, found the country thickly
settled and full of orchards:<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>"During the greater part of the day we had very extensive corn
fields on both sides of the road. * * * Near almost every farm was
a spacious orchard full of peach and apple trees, and in some of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
the fruit had fallen from the trees in such quantities as to cover nearly
the whole surface. Part of it they left to rot, because they could not
take it all in and consume it. Wherever we passed by we were always
welcome to go into the fine orchards and gather our hats and pockets full
of the choicest fruit, without the possessors so much as looking after it."</p>

<p>The soil and climate of Long Island and the lower reaches of the
Hudson, similar to those of the Chesapeake peach-belt, are so well adapted
to peaches that we may be sure that the early settlers in New York eked
out their scanty fare with this fruit soon after settlements were made.
Trade with the colonies to the south, where peaches were common before
the Dutch were established on Manhattan Island, began almost immediately
after the arrival of the Hollanders in America, and knowledge of
the adaptability of peaches to conditions in the New World was no doubt
quickly acquired from Virginia, if, indeed, the aborigines were not cultivating
this fruit in the region as Penn found them doing on the site of
Philadelphia. Yet careful search in the colonial records of New York
shows no early accounts of peaches, there being few such accounts, by the
way, of any agricultural product, no one having undertaken the task of
describing the natural and agricultural resources of this State as was done
by several able observers for Virginia and the New England states.</p>

<p>No doubt, however, orchard-planting as a general practice was long
delayed in New York because of political and economic conditions. The
Dutch came to America as traders and not as home-makers, and almost
from the day they landed were in trouble with both their savage and their
civilized neighbors so that actual or petty warfare prevented them from
planting orchards until in 1647 when the reins of government were taken
in hand by Peter Stuyvesant, a farmer as well as a soldier, who at once
set about encouraging the planting of fields, gardens and orchards. He
brought, we are told, fruits, flowers, farm and truck-crops from the neighboring
colonies and Holland and these he not only planted on Manhattan
Island but sent to the settlements up the Hudson. The peach may readily
be grown in suitable soils from Albany down the river to New York, and,
by the end of the Seventeenth Century, we are told by travelers, naturalists
and missionaries that this fruit was in common cultivation by the whites
and was even rudely tilled by the Indians of the Hudson Valley.</p>

<p>But, in eastern New York, away from the coast, the peach did not
find the climate as congenial as in the colonies to the south and then, too,
from the following record, the peach-borer early became troublesome.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Kalm says:<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> "Peach-trees have often been planted here (Albany, New
York) and never would succeed well. This was attributed to a worm
which lives in the ground, and eats through the root, so that the tree dies.
Perhaps the severity of the winter contributes much to it." We have
another reference to show that winter-killing must have been a discouraging
factor in peach-culture in this part of New York in early days as it is now.
Cadwallader Colden, appointed first surveyor-general of New York in
1719, and in 1761 lieutenant-governor of the Province, a botanist of note,
who had a patent of land in what is now Orange County, wrote in 1737
that cold had killed the peach-trees the previous winter.</p>

<p>The traveler who visits New York today finds many orchards on the
Hudson but in them he sees comparatively few peaches. The peach is
much more at home two hundred miles west about the Central Lakes and
along the shores of Lake Ontario. Here, it is interesting to learn, peaches
were grown in considerable quantities long before the region was settled
by the whites&mdash;how long we have no record nor do we know much of the
character of the fruit. John Bartram in his <i>Travels from Pensilvania to
Onondago, Oswego and the Lake Ontario</i>, an account of a journey made in
1743, mentions apples, peaches, plums and grapes growing about the
Indian villages passed through on his route. Whether these peaches came
from the white settlements nearer the Atlantic, or at a much earlier date
from the Indians to the South, or both, we cannot even surmise.</p>

<p>Sullivan's army, which came to this region in 1779 to chastise the
Indians, found and destroyed considerable numbers of fruit-trees, among
them many peaches. After Sullivan's raid the region was quickly settled
by whites who, following the examples of the Indians, planted apples and
peaches, the orchard soon becoming a prominent asset to every farm.
Collections of pioneer papers frequently mention the great adaptability
of these lake-regions to peaches. In Conover's <i>History of Kanadasaga
and Geneva</i><a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> there are sixteen references to the peach-orchards about Seneca
and Cayuga lakes in and about the year 1800. As in the South, the products
seem to have been used chiefly in making peach-brandy.</p>

<p>David Thomas,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> Aurora, Cayuga County, New York, was the pioneer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
horticulturist, fruit-grower and nurseryman in this part of the State and
soon after coming to New York in 1805, we learn from several references
to his orchards and nurseries in his own writings, began planting peaches.
All of the named varieties from the South and East were tried in his orchard
and if valuable were propagated and sold from his nursery. According
to his son, John Jacob Thomas, the pomological writer, he had in 1830 "the
most extensive and valuable collection of bearing trees west of the Hudson."
Through him the western counties of the State were stocked with named
peaches and other fruits.</p>

<p>Of peaches in the New England colonies, we need say but little. Except
in favored parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts, this fruit was little
grown in these northern colonies. It is not at all probable that New
England Indians ever planted peaches and for a generation after the whites
came the struggle for the necessities of life kept them from indulging in so
great a luxury as a peach-orchard. Strong drink was as commonly used
by the Puritans as by the Churchmen in Virginia and peach-brandy would
have been as acceptable but it was easier to produce cider, and rum from
the West Indies could be had with little trouble. Still, peaches were
sparingly grown in the New England colonies.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Company in 1629 sent peach-pits, along with seeds
of other fruits, to be planted by the colonists.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> Twelve years later George
Fenwick, Saybrook, Connecticut, writes to Governor Winthrop that he is
"prettie well storred with chirrie &amp; peach trees."<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> Justice Paul Dudley,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
who seems to have been the leading horticulturist in Massachusetts in his
time, writes in 1726: "Our Peaches do rather excel those of <i>England</i>, and
then we have not the Trouble or Expence of Walls for them; for our Peach
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Trees are all Standards, and I have had in my own Garden seven or eight
Hundred fine Peaches of the Rare-ripes, growing at a Time on one Tree."
From another statement made by Justice Dudley,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> we learn that peaches
were still being grown from the stone and may assume that budding was
not known or so careful a horticulturist as our author would have mentioned
it. He says: "Our Peach Trees are large and fruitful, and bear
commonly in three Years from the Stone. I have one in my Garden of
twelve Years Growth, that measures two Foot and an Inch in Girt a Yard
from the Ground, which, two Years ago, bore me near a Bushel of fine
Peaches."</p>

<h3>SEEDLINGS GIVE WAY TO BUDDED TREES</h3>

<p>About the close of the Eighteenth Century the planting of pits for
permanent trees began to give way to budding. It does not appear who
began budding peaches on this side of the Atlantic but the desirability of
budded stock was discussed as early as 1736, for in that year we find the
English botanist, Peter Collinson, urging his American colleague, John
Bartram, to "graft Plums and Nectarines on Peach stocks."<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> The matter
had evidently been under consideration before for Collinson tells Bartram
"Pray try; I have great opinion of its succeeding."<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> Bartram is hard to
convince and ten years later Collinson is still urging him to bud, for, in a
letter of April 26, 1746, he writes, rather impatiently, "Though thou canst
not see, yet I have told thee what inoculating a Peach stock may do."<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>Probably the Princes, pioneer nurserymen in America, in their nursery
at Flushing, Long Island, first began to bud the peach, for in their catalog
of 1771 they offer 29 sorts though most of these appear to be types rather
than varieties. Twenty years later they list 35 varieties with the statement
that all "are inoculated." John Kenrick,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> father of William Kenrick,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the pomological author, who for years was Prince's chief competitor,
his nurseries being located at Newton, Massachusetts, began business in
1790 by planting a quantity of peach-stones the trees from which he did
not bud. Four years later, we are told, he learned to bud and greatly
extended his assortment of varieties, making a specialty of budded peach-trees.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>Until the middle of the next century, peaches were nevertheless commonly
grown from the pits. It is probable that never before nor since, the
world over, have seedling peaches been raised on so extended a scale as in
America during the half-century following the Revolutionary war. The
country between the Atlantic seaboard and the Mississippi was being rapidly
settled and on nearly every farm from the Great Lakes to the Gulf, barring
a few in the northernmost parts of this great area, peaches were planted.
They furnished food not only for the pioneers but were used in fattening
pigs and in the earlier part of the period, at any rate, were, with apples,
the chief supply of ardent spirits which every farmer then kept on hand for
daily use. There were millions of peach-trees in America before 1825
but until that time there were but few named varieties. Then the art of
budding began to spread; nurseries sprang up; this vast collection of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
peaches was passed through the sieve of selection; local varieties quickly
acquired fame; and, as means of communication developed, the new varieties
began to be disseminated, until, in 1850, American nurseries were selling
over 400 varieties, a number which at the close of the century had increased
to over 1000.</p>

<h3>THE CARE OF THE PEACH IN COLONIAL TIMES</h3>

<p>Peach-growers, in the period under consideration, gave their trees
much the same care as is given in the present time except that they did not
spray. Pests were fewer and yet some were especially troublesome, notably
the peach-borer, the remedies for which were as numerous as today.
Curculio, then as now, almost prohibited the culture of nectarines. A rot,
the brown-rot, without doubt, did much damage. Peach-yellows, as yet,
was not the scourge it now is but, as we shall see, was well in evidence.
There were faddists in those days as in these. Thomas Coulter of Bedford
County, Pennsylvania, was one of the original "sod-mulchers"&mdash;at least
year in and year out he inveighed against cultivation. He managed to get
himself in all of the publications of the times for a period of a half-century.
We find his method discussed in Volume V of the Transactions of the
American Philosophical Society, in the <i>Domestic Encyclopaedia</i><a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> in 1803
and, as late as 1821, a full account was published in the <i>American Farmer</i>.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
We quote the article in full, as it came out in the three publications named,
as a record of the times and because it contains a number of novel ideas
some of which may commend themselves to modern orchardists of the
sod-mulch school who want a cheap and easy way of growing peaches.</p>

<p>"Transplant your peach-trees, as young as possible, where you mean
them to stand; if, in the kernel, so much the better ... because, in that
case, there will be no check of growth, which always injures peach-trees.
Plant peach-trees 16 feet apart, both ways, except you would wish to
take your waggon through the orchard to carry the peaches away; in that
case, give 24 feet distance to every fifth row, one way, after transplanting.
You may plough and harrow amongst your peach-trees, for two years,
paying no regard to wounding or tearing them, so that you do not take
them up by the roots. In the month of March, or April, in the third year
after transplanting, <i>cut them all off by the ground</i>; plough and harrow amongst
them as before, taking special care not to wound or tear them in the smallest
degree, letting all the sprouts or scions grow that will grow; cut none away,
supposing six or more should come from the old stump; the young scions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
will grow up to bearing trees on account of the roots being strong. Let
no kind of beasts into peach-orchards, <i>hogs excepted</i>, for fear of wounding
the trees; as the least wound will greatly injure the tree, by draining away
that substance which is the life thereof; although the tree may live many
years, the produce is not so great, neither is the fruit so good.</p>

<p>After the old stock is cut away, the third year after transplanting,
the sprouts or scions will grow up, all round the old stump, from four to
six in number; no more will come to maturity, than the old stump can support
and nourish; the remainder will die before ever they bear fruit. These
may be cut away, taking care not to wound any part of any stock, or the
bark. The sprouts growing all round the old stump, when loaded with
fruit will bend and rest on the ground in every direction, without injuring
any of them, for many years, all of them being rooted in the ground, as
tho' they had been planted. The stocks will remain tough, and the bark
smooth for 2 years and upwards; if any of the sprouts or trees from the
old stump should happen to split off, or die, cut them away, they will be
supplied from the ground, by young trees, so that you will have trees from
the same stump for 100 years, as I believe. I now have trees, 36, 20, 10,
5 and down to one year old, all from the same stump.</p>

<p>The young trees coming up, after any of the old trees split off or die,
and are cut away, will bear fruit the second year; but this fruit will not
ripen so easily as the fruit on the old trees from the same stem. Three
years after the trees are cut off by the ground, they will be sufficiently
large and bushy, to shade the ground so as to prevent grass of any kind from
matting or binding the surface, so as to injure the trees; therefore; ploughing
is useless, as well as injurious; useless, because nothing can be raised
in the orchard, by reason the trees will shade all the ground, or nearly
so; injurious, because either the roots, stocks or branches will be wounded:
neither is it necessary ever to manure peach-trees, as manured trees will
always produce less and worse fruit, than trees that are not manured;
although by manuring your peach-trees, they will grow larger, and look
greener and thicker in the boughs, and cause a thicker shade, yet on them
will grow very little fruit, and that little will be of a very bad kind
generally looking as green as the leaves, even when ripe, and later than
those that never have been manured."</p>

<p>None of the varieties that we now grow was then cultivated. Taking
the sorts described in 1800 we find that four were red-fleshed; eight, yellow-fleshed;
thirty-four, white-fleshed; eighteen, freestones; nineteen, clingstones,
and twelve nectarines. There were no flat, or Peento, peaches
but a sort known as Venus's Nipple was seemingly a typical beaked peach.</p>

<p>In 1800, Baltimore was the best market for peaches in America and
was near the Chesapeake peach-belt. We are fortunate in having a description
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
of peach-growing around Baltimore at about that time. Richard
Parkinson, an English farmer and agricultural writer, came to America
to rent one of George Washington's farms in 1798. The two could not
agree and Parkinson rented a farm near Baltimore on which was a peach-orchard.
He published an account of his experiences in two very readable
volumes and from this work we quote in part the story of his peach-orchard.
Perhaps allowances should be made, for Parkinson seems to have been
soured by failure and some of his expressions are such as might be expected
from an opinionated Englishman undergoing new experiences in America
just after the Revolution. Parkinson says:<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>"It would astonish a stranger to see the quantity of fruit in these
parts, which makes the country to look beautiful twice a-year, when the
trees are in blossom, and when the fruit is on the trees ripe. But the fruit
is chiefly for the use of hogs and can be applied to no better purpose.</p>

<p>On my farm at Orange-Hill, only three miles from Baltimore, the
last year I was there, I sold all my peaches to two men at four pence per
peck, and let them have a cart and a horse to take them into the city to
sell, knowing I had only made four pence per peck on the average the year
before, and gathered them myself. These men agreed to pick them, and
feed the horse in town at their expence. It was the opinion of every one
that they had got a great bargain, and many others wished they had had
it. They picked about one-half of them, and carried them to Baltimore:
but, alas! they gave up the business, saying they could not make wages,
although they at first had said that they would certainly take every peach,
intending, if the market should not suit, to carry them to the stills, &amp;c.
I was in hopes all this exertion would make this bargain successful, as four
pence per peck would pay much better than to give them to hogs, as I have
no knowledge of what number a hog will eat. Seeing this scheme frustrated,
and thinking it a sin and a shame to see such a number of fine peaches
rot on the ground, I mounted my horse and rode to the stills, as there were
many small ones within three or four miles of me in the country. They
have been erected for this use; but many of them are never used after the
first year; and I am of the opinion that they will not pay expences. The
men at the stills were civil enough; they offered to lend me the still, and
let me find a man to work it, &amp;c. or they would work it for me; but, from
every information I could obtain, I found that my peaches would not more
than pay the carriage to the stills and hardly that; and after selling them
to the owners of the stills, they would not give me so much for my fruit,
as would pay me for my trouble; nor will peaches pay the farmer, to be given
to the hogs, if they be not so situated that the hogs can run where they are;
and that happened not to be my case.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>As a striking instance of the little profit of stills, Mr. O'Donnel,
at Canton, had planted an orchard, of great extent, of red peaches, for the
purpose of making peach-brandy. The red peach is reckoned much
superior to any other for brandy. Although Mr. O'Donnel's orchard had
grown to bear in great perfection and he had a still and the other necessary
apparatus, the profit proved so small, that he suffered the whole to go
waste, and his pigs consumed the produce; and, in the winter, rooted up
all those fine peach trees, and planted the ground with Indian corn, having
previously manured the land with dung from Baltimore for the purpose
of an orchard. Now this gentleman had some hundreds of acres of woodlands
unimproved in this plantation; therefore, the cause could not be for
want of land.</p>

<p>My fine turnips, Indian corn, potatoes, &amp;c. were in the field by the
orchard without any fence. Indeed hogs are not allowed to run at large
within five miles of Baltimore, by an act of assembly; and mine were too
valuable to risk such a misfortune; and especially as I was a great hog-shooter
myself, it would have been fine diversion for any of my neighbours
to have shot one of my fifty-dollar pigs. Seeing that these plants would
not succeed, all that remained was to fatten my own hogs with them. I
had but seven hogs; and they would have employed a man with horse and
cart half a day to feed them; for, after a short time, they will only eat the
best peaches, and refuse the others as a man would. I found this plan
would not answer; and the consequence was, that, after every trial and
exertion, they rotted on the ground. Now my farm was so situated that
the great road through the heart of the country went through it, five or six
stage-coaches, and great numbers of other carriages of all kinds. In all
probability some of my own countrymen as merchants (for there begin to
be many of these gentlemen to settle their accounts with the American
merchants, and I suppose they will increase) seeing this waste committed,
would, on returning to England, relate their story in this way&mdash;That
when at the tavern at Baltimore on the same day, the fruit-people were
asking eleven pence apiece for peaches. An Englishman says to himself,
'What idle fools those Americans are! and I think all the English, when
they get to America, are as bad: but, when I get there, I will set them the
example.' But when there, he finds himself much disappointed, and does
not know how it is that he does not increase in riches, while neither himself
nor his family enjoys any comfort. He at last finds out that the
Americans are not a set of fools as he once thought: and, as he must have
a name for them, perhaps he calls them rogues; which, if Lord Chesterfield
was right in his observation, pleases a man the best of the two.</p>

<p>When I took this farm, I had not a doubt, that, by some extraordinary
exertion, I should be able to make something handsome from
peaches, and so near Baltimore. Before I took the farm, when I enquired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
how peaches sold in the market, perhaps they would tell me eleven pence
apiece, and eleven pence a peck on the same day. That used to stagger
me very much: but it is so: and the man who offers you a fine Newington
peach for eleven pence or a five-penny bit, sells but few each day; and lives,
although very poorly, at a very great expence; consequently his profit
must be great on each article. The man who sells the peaches at eleven
pence each, will not grow rich by his business, any more than the grower.
Then we come to the calculation of my profit at four pence per peck, which
is the best and greatest price. Could the scheme be put in execution, it
will, generally speaking, require two men and one horse and cart each day,
to pick thirty pecks and carry them to market; and thirty pecks are more
than any white man can sell one day with another. A black man is much
better for this business than a white man; although they are in general
ignorant, they are impudent: thirty pecks of peaches, at four pence per
peck, is just ten shillings per day for peaches; and the two men's wages are
worth, at that season of the year, one dollar per day each, and one pint of
whiskey, which will be sixteen shillings for the men: the cart and horse are
worth one dollar and a half per day; but you could not hire it for less than
two dollars. Now the expences on this business are one pound seven
shillings and three pence per day, and the produce is ten shillings. But
as I sold them, I made profit each day on thirty pecks of peaches two
shillings and nine pence: the reader may plainly see that there could not
be any thing done better. This shews in this part of the work where
I am on the Eastern Shore, one hundred miles and upwards from market,
that the reader will be convinced the cherries and peaches pay the best for
hogs."</p>

<h3>ADAPTABILITY AND VARIABILITY IN THE PEACH</h3>

<p>In the preceding pages our narrative has flitted from continent to
continent and country to country in a belt encircling the earth. Few other
fruits are found under such varied conditions and over such extended areas.
We have seen that peaches are found wild and cultivated over much of
Japan; as far north as Vladivostock in Korea; once a wild inhabitant of
some part of China it is now cultivated in nearly every section of that
vast empire where agriculture is an industry; the trees are so abundant
and so much at home in the orchards and forests of the Turkestans and
Persia as to have given rise to the belief that they have always grown
there. While not so common as in Asia, yet peaches thrive in all of
southern Europe and readily submit to artificial culture in pots and on
walls in northern European latitudes. Coming to America with the first
Spaniards, the peach found such congenial surroundings that it spread
rapidly, freely and widely, leading botanists three centuries later to call it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
a native. In the fruit-areas of the United States, after two centuries of
cultivation, though sometimes a luxury and the crop often a speculation,
the peach is so perennially plentiful that it is to be found, fresh, canned or
evaporated, in every home in the land and the species is represented in
American pomologies by over 1000 sorts which have originated in this
country.</p>

<p>However, in tracing the history of the peach from China to America,
we have not wholly shown the range of adaptability of this fruit. The
peach has become adapted to the clear skies, strong light, long seasons and
hot climate of northern Africa, where, under modified cultural treatment,
it is a common fruit in Egypt<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> and the other states bordering on the
Mediterranean. It thrives on the islands in the Mediterranean and on
those of the North Temperate zone almost to the tropics in the Atlantic
and the Pacific, as the Azores, Canaries, West Indies and Hawaiian group.
As long ago as 1649 the Azores were famous for peaches and Colonel
Norwood, author of <i>A Voyage to Virginia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> in a gustatory reminiscence
tells us that they were of so good quality that he "did not fail to visit
and revisit them in the dead of night to satisfy a ravenous appetite nature
has too prodigally given me for that species." In the sub-tropic climate
of Guadeloupe Islands, French West Indies, there is a peach peculiar to
the region differing in shape, flavor and in heat-resisting qualities from
the common run of this fruit.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>The Aryan race has taken the peach across the equator in the pathways
of discovery, conquest and civilization, and made it a favorite fruit
in the gardens and orchards of the South Temperate as well as in those of
the North Temperate zone. In the colonies of South Africa the peach
seems to be as common as any deciduous fruit, native sorts being planted
with those from Europe and America. Of the Transvaal Yellow Peach,
R. A. Davis, horticulturist of the colony, says:<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> "Generally speaking,
it is the fruit most commonly grown in the Transvaal, and it may safely
be said that where it will not grow no other peach stands much chance of
thriving. The writer has seen them flourishing by the side of the railroad
amongst granite boulders, the result of a chance pit thrown from the
window of a railway carriage. It is also extensively grown as a hedge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
around homesteads, having been planted after the primitive method of
turning a furrow where the hedge was wanted and simply dropping the
seeds in after the plough. It is commonly recognised that the peach
hedge should duly appear and bear fruit in two years from planting the
seed. The writer has also seen them growing by the side of water-furrows
and dams, with the whole of the roots on one side of the tree at least
immersed in water."</p>

<p>The Spaniards, no doubt, planted the peach in parts of South America
soon after the discovery of the continent and it now runs wild on both
coasts. Thus, Darwin in his famous voyage found the islands at the
mouth of the Parana River, Argentina, "thickly clothed with peach and
orange trees carried there by the waters of the river."<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> Many references
to wild peaches on the Pacific Coast may be found, as interesting as any
being one from Bertero who says that on Robinson Crusoe's island, Juan
Fernandez,<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> "The peach is so abundant that one can scarcely form an
idea of the quantity of fruit that it bears. They are in general of good
quality despite the state of wildness." According to Oakenfull,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> in Brazil,
"Of all the fruits introduced from abroad, the peach has made itself more
at home than any." Wight<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> reports the peach and nectarine in Argentina,
Chile, Peru and Bolivia under cultivation and as escapes from cultivation
in seemingly all degrees of evolution. The peach-drying industry
is important in the province of Coquimbo, Chile. According to Lounsbury
the peach is the most common fruit-tree in Argentina. He says:<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>
"It grows almost everywhere most luxuriantly, bears heavily and as yet
no very serious insect or fungus pest for it has become widespread. Solid
blocks of thousands of trees are not uncommon about Buenos Ayres.
Most of the choice varieties of Europe and America have been introduced."
The culture of this fruit in South America falls short of that in North
America only because of the lack of advancement in horticulture&mdash;the
one continent is a century behind the other in this field of agriculture.</p>

<p>In temperate Oceanica the peach plays as important a part in horticulture
as any other of the deciduous tree-fruits. In early days in New
Zealand, "vast groves of peaches existed, sometimes, as in the Waikato,
extending for miles, where magnificently grown trees cropped without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
limit."<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> Both the peach and nectarine are grown in the horticultural
regions of the island. Wherever the fruits of temperate climates are cultivated
in Australia, there may the peach be found. If one may judge from
the attention given this fruit in the agricultural literature of New Zealand
and Australia, it holds the same high place in the horticulture of these
islands in the Pacific that it has in Europe and America.</p>

<p>The types of peaches are almost as diverse as the regions in which the
fruit is an inhabitant. The 2181 varieties described in <i>The Peaches of
New York</i> attest the variability of the species in America and Europe,
many of our sorts having come from the Old World. This great number
of kinds can be distinguished by reason of differences in skin, flesh, flavor,
aroma, stone and season, the attributes of which have been mentioned
several times in foregoing paragraphs. The structure of leaf and tree
offers as many more taxonomic characters. It is interesting to note the
extreme forms in fruit and tree the peach has taken on in its centuries of
world-wide wanderings.</p>

<p>Round, flat, beaked, free or clingstone peaches with smooth or downy
skins and red, yellow or white flesh, sweet, sour or bitter, in all combinations,
and each often modified by soil and climate, are known to American
growers of this fruit. But there are many peaches with less well-known
characters. Thus, a peach in China bears fruits as heavy as one pound
apiece with extraordinary keeping and shipping qualities;<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> another Chinese
peach of the Honey type has a tree with a maximum height of only seven or
eight feet;<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> growing in the same locality, Poliping, China, is a variety with
extraordinarily long leaves;<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> the <i>Paak wat to</i> peach from China is a white-stoned
sort;<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> a variety in the French West Indies has fruits that peel easily
and withstand a continuous temperature in ripening season of 76 to 90
degrees;<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> from Kashgar comes a peach that will keep for several months;<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
in Chinese Turkestan there is a nectarine "said to keep for several weeks
after fully ripe;"<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> even more remarkable is the Feitcheng peach which
ripens in late September and can be kept, if wrapped in paper, until February;<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
as remarkable as any is the Transvaal Yellow of South Africa
which we have seen in a foregoing paragraph grows "amongst granite
boulders," "as a hedge around homesteads" and "beside water furrows
and dams, the roots of one side of the tree immersed in water;" the Fragrant
Peach and the Firm Peach from China are not yet known in America;<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
another Chinese peach is a dwarf, "grown in pots indoors, which fruits
at a height of fifteen inches and bears peaches on the main trunk though
the stem be scarcely larger than a lead pencil."<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> Most of the examples
named are from China but others can be found in every distinct region in
which peaches have long been grown.</p>

<p>Every well-marked geographical region in which the peach is grown
comes, sooner or later, to have a type of varieties of its own; yet the universal
stamp of the peach&mdash;of cultivated <i>Prunus persica</i>&mdash;is on them all.
These facts imply two important things. First, the peach is an exceedingly
flexible fruit, capable of being moulded to fit many conditions of environment;
and, under cultivation, training, feeding and culture in unlike regions,
soils and climates, may still be greatly improved and the improvements
all intensified and augmented by crossing and selecting. Second, the peach,
a gift to the world from China, has seemingly, in its centuries of cultivation
by the Orientals, taken on sufficient immutability to make it one of
the most stable of species, especially in its fruits. The many races and
thousands of varieties are all best put in one species; many varieties come
true to seed; and peaches from seed seldom "revert" to worthless forms
as so many seedling fruits habitually do. Cultivated plants, as all who
work with them know, differ widely in variability. Some, as corn, the
cucurbits, and grapes and plums with their many species, are so variable
as to be almost unmanageable in attempts to improve them; others, as the
cereals, are quite too immutable for the best work of the breeder. The peach
is neither a stone wall nor shifting sand in the matter of variability.

<small>BOTANICAL AND HORTICULTURAL CLASSIFICATIONS OF
THE PEACH</small></h2>

<h3>PLACE OF THE PEACH IN THE GENUS PRUNUS</h3>

<p>The genus Prunus is without peer in the number of distinct, natural,
esculent products it furnishes man. Here belong the stone-fruits&mdash;peaches,
plums, cherries, almonds and apricots, represented by some forty edible
species, which, through long domestication, have been broken up into not
less than 5000 orchard-varieties, of which at least 3000 are now under
cultivation. Of the two-score cultivated species of this genus, <i>Prunus
persica</i>, the common peach, is easily the most remarkable when judged
either by the senses which make foods palatable and pleasant or by the
criteria that establish the commercial worth of a product. As virtues
which give the peach leading place among stone-fruits, we may specify:
Wider distribution and consequently commoner cultivation and a greater
number of varieties; larger size, greater beauty, pleasanter and more
diversified taste, and more culinary uses than other stone-fruits; and
greater productiveness, more rapid growth and earlier fruiting of the trees
than most of the species of the genus. The place of the peach in the genus
Prunus is thus easily established from a horticultural point of view, but it
is a much more difficult matter to make clear its botanical standing among
the species with which it is considered botanically related.</p>

<p>The botanical relations of the several stone-fruits to each other have
been set forth in the foregoing books of this series on plums and cherries,
but, for the convenience of those who may not have these treatises, a
summary of the relationships of the species of Prunus is presented.
Besides, greater emphasis on several differences between the peach and its
congeners is needed. In particular, since some notable naturalists have
held that the peach is a modified almond, the differences between these
two fruits must be more clearly set forth.</p>

<p>Nearly every botanist who has done much towards classifying plants
has grouped the stone-fruits according to a plan of his own and there are,
therefore, many classification schemes and consequently a most confused
nomenclature for this genus. Happily, the pitfalls in synonomy dug by
botanists need not worry horticulturists; for each of the stone-fruits constitutes
a distinct horticultural group. In tree or fruit of peach, plum,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
cherry, apricot, or almond, who could mistake one for another? For
horticultural purposes we accept as best one of the oldest and yet one of
the most commonly used classifications which places in one genus all of
the stone-fruits. What are the lines of cleavage between the several stone-fruits
of common cultivation?</p>

<p>Stone-fruits fall naturally into two distinct groups. In the first the
leaves are rolled in the buds&mdash;convolute. The plums and the apricots
belong to this section. In the buds of the other group the leaves are folded
lengthwise along the midrib&mdash;conduplicate. To this section belong
almonds, peaches and cherries. The two sections seem to be united in this
matter of disposition of leaves in the bud, it should be said in passing, by
a few species of American plums which are conduplicate in vernation.
The second section is further subdivided by very marked differences in the
fruits. The fruits of the peach and almond are larger than those of the
cherry, less juicy,&mdash;in the case of the almond almost dry,&mdash;hirsute (except
in the nectarine), and are borne without stems; and the blossoms usually
appear long before the opening of the leaves. Cherry-fruits are always
juicy, usually glabrous, and are borne on more or less distinct stems;
and the blossoms appear with the leaves. Botanists who put these fruits
in one genus usually redivide according to the characters given so that the
plum and apricot stand in one sub-genus (Euprunus), the almond and
peach in another (Amygdalus), and the cherry in a third (Cerasus).</p>

<p>Differentiating more closely, we find that it is not so easy to distinguish
between the peach and the almond. The likenesses are so many
and so apparent that it is not to be wondered that Knight, whose theory
we have discussed on a foregoing page, came to the conclusion that the
peach is a modified almond, or that Darwin, with his belief that plants
came sooner or later to express their environmental conditions, should be
inclined to believe that the peach is an evolution from the almond. It is
easy to imagine that countless ages ago&mdash;how long since is but an invitation
to argue&mdash;the two species merged into one. Offspring of the parent-species
once established in distinct soil and climatic conditions&mdash;the peach in
China, the almond in southwestern Asia&mdash;differentiation began and in
time each region was represented by a species of its own. Such an occurrence
is but one of the commonplaces of evolution; but Knight, Lindley
and Darwin thought they saw evidence that the separation came after the
almond, the supposed parent-species, had been domesticated, the steps
being from fleshy almond to bad clingstone, to good clingstone, to freestone,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
to nectarine. The arguments against such a descent have been given
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The chief differences between the two species are to be found in the
matured fruits though, at first thought, it might appear that these are not
greater than those found in widely separated varieties of either of the two
species. The fruits of the peach and the almond are, however, much more
widely separated than any of the varieties of either species, inasmuch as
the differences are several and have to do with parts not usually affected
by cultivation and not the subject of selection by the cultivator. Thus,
the fruit of the peach is a delectable esculent; that of the almond inedible;
the flesh of the peach, the mesocarp, is soft, fleshy, juicy; that of the almond
thin, tough and leathery; the pit of the peach must be removed while that
of the almond drops naturally from the hard flesh which splits at maturity.
The differences between the pits of the two species are quite as marked as
in the flesh of the fruit. The pit of the peach is deeply sculptured, pitted,
and of a bone-like consistency; that of the almond is nearly smooth and in
most varieties is much thinner and of softer texture. The differences in
the kernels are such as could easily be brought about by selection, some
peach-kernels being sweet and edible and some almond-kernels being too
bitter to be palatable.</p>

<p>Coming to the tree-characters we find that there are several which
differ sufficiently to give each of the two fruits distinct specific rank. The
winter aspect of the two trees is wholly different. The almond resembles
a young apple tree in color of bark more than it does the peach and has,
too, a head much like that of a broad-topped, much-branched apple. In
foliage the distant aspect is much the same, but examined closely there are
several distinctions that hold in comparing the two species. The leaves
of the peach are more broadly lanceolate than those of the almond, coarsely
serrate or crenate while the margins of almond-leaves are finely serrate.
The glands on the leaf-stalk or leaf of the peach are globose, reniform or
mixed; on the almond, the glands are globose. The flowers in the two
species are similar but the time of flowering is markedly different. The
color of the petals in both varies from pale pink to deep pink with occasional
pure white forms; the flowers of true almonds are always large while those
of the peach are about equally divided between large and small. The
almond, in New York, is out of bloom before flowers of the peach appear,
the difference in blooming-time being from one to three weeks.

<h3>TREE- AND FRUIT-CHARACTERS OF THE PEACH</h3>

<p>Fruit-growers must largely depend on printed descriptions for
knowledge of varieties. A well-made description of tree or fruit, to one
mentally equipped to interpret it, is second only to having the real objects
at hand. But the difficulty is that few excepting professional pomologists
know the characters of even the common fruits and their relative importance.
Before taking up either botanical or horticultural descriptions of
peaches, then, it is necessary to direct attention to the characters of the
peach, differences in which distinguish species and varieties. Be it
remembered in this study of the characters of the peach, however, that,
as fields and woods offer better facilities for the botanist than the herbarium,
so the peach-orchard is a fitter place to study the characters of
the peach than a printed page.</p>

<p>The single species of the peach in which we are greatly interested has
a very characteristic tree, the variations in which are, however, less well
marked than those of the tree of any other of our common fruits. The
peach-tree is distinguished by its low, roundish and never pyramidal head.
Of its gross characters, size is most important in distinguishing varieties,
the several more or less distinct types in the species usually being separable
by size alone. In considering size, proper allowance must, of course, always
be made for environment. There are no true dwarfs among the varieties
of <i>Prunus persica</i> cultivated in America.</p>

<p>Habit of growth is nearly as important as size of tree in determining
varieties. Thus, a variety may be round-topped, upright-spreading or
drooping in habit; the head may be open or dense; the branches long or
short, stout or slender; the trunks may be short or long, straight or crooked,
much branched or little branched. These habits of growth serve not
only to distinguish sorts but often determine whether the tree is sufficiently
manageable to make a good orchard-plant.</p>

<p>Hardiness is an important character both in classifying and in determining
the orchard-value of a variety. All peaches are tender to cold as
compared with other tree-fruits of temperate climates but there is sufficient
difference in varieties to permit the designations hardy, half-hardy and
tender. In the classificatory scheme in most common use in America,
that of Onderdonk and Price, variation in hardiness is the chief determinant
of groups.</p>

<p>All peaches come in bearing so early and bear so regularly that varietal
differences in these characters scarcely count in classifying, but productiveness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
varies very characteristically in different varieties. Environment
and care greatly influence fruitfulness yet, notwithstanding, the
quantity of fruit borne is often a means of identifying a variety and, of
course, must always be considered by the cultivator and the breeder.</p>

<p>Resistance to disease and insects is a taxonomic and an economic
character of much importance. Thus there are great variations among
varieties in resistance to peach-yellows, brown-rot and leaf-curl, the three
commonest diseases of this fruit in New York, as there is also in resistance
to San Jose scale, the worst insect-pest of the peach in this region and
to the peach-borer, the commonest. These examples are multiplied
in the discussions of varieties, pains having been taken in the peach-orchards
at this Station to determine the relative resistance of all varieties
to the pests of this region.</p>

<p>But little attention need be paid to the old bark on peach-trees, since
in all varieties it is much the same and is unimportant to the cultivator.
The bark of all varieties varies in color on different soils and is always
of a lighter hue in cold than in warm regions, in dry than in wet situations.</p>

<p>The branches and branchlets of varieties are very characteristic. The
length, thickness, direction, rigidity and the branching angle are all stable
characters of varieties, changing but little with differences in soil and
climate. The length of the internode is important as is also color, smoothness,
amount of pubescence, size and appearance of the lenticels, and the
presence of excrescences,&mdash;though all are exceedingly variable.</p>

<p>Both leaf-buds and fruit-buds are used in separating groups of peaches
but are too nearly alike in the several groups to be of aid in distinguishing
the varieties of any group. Fruit-buds are borne in pairs on the wood of
the previous year with a leaf-bud separating the members of the pair.
The only characters of buds worth noting are size, shape, color and the
angle at which the buds stand out from the branches.</p>

<p>After the fruits, the leaves offer the best means of determining groups
and varieties of peaches. Leaves are variable, it is true, but usually within
limits quite easily set, since the conditions causing the variations are easily
discovered. The most usual ones are extremes in soil, moisture, light,
heat and the age of the wood upon which the leaves are borne. Much
care has been taken to illustrate as accurately as possible the leaves of the
varieties given color-plates in this text, size and form being reproduced
exactly and color as nearly as color-plate printing permits.</p>

<p>Leaf-size and leaf-form are the first characters of the foliage to study
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
in determining varieties. The former varies somewhat in accordance
with the conditions named in the foregoing paragraph but the shape of
the leaf changes but little. Fortunately for the student of varieties, leaves
differ most in relative length and breadth so that the shape may be
accurately indicated by figures which are used in most of the descriptions
in <i>The Peaches of New York</i>. Comparisons of the bases and the apices
of leaves of different varieties often show distinguishing marks.</p>

<p>The color of leaves in varieties is very constant for both surfaces.
The color of the foliage gives an aspect to peaches whereby a variety may
often be distinguished in its summer dress at considerable distance. Unfortunately,
the colors of leaves in the color-plates in this book cannot be
relied upon to give much help in studying this character. Autumnal
tints are uniformly the same in peaches and not to be relied upon in classifying
varieties.</p>

<p>Several other characters of the leaves must be studied by the systematic
pomologist. The leaves of some varieties are thinner than those of
others, hence thickness becomes a distinguishing character. Venation
of leaves&mdash;size and arrangement of veins&mdash;is important. Pubescence
of leaves cuts quite a figure in the descriptions of many fruits but in the
peach is of minor importance because the leaves are not very hairy and the
quantity and character of the pubescence is exceedingly variable. Some
varieties have relatively few leaves&mdash;others many. The leaves of some
varieties fall early&mdash;others relatively late.</p>

<p>The margins of peach-leaves offer valuable evidence in determining
varieties. They may be serrate or crenate, doubly or singly divided,
glandular or glandless. Both serrations and glands are best studied in the
middle of the sides of leaves, those at the base or apex often being crowded
or wanting.</p>

<p>Petioles differ in length, thickness, rigidity, pubescence and color,
so that this organ is often a substantial help in identifying varieties. Some
say the color of the petiole is correlated with that of the fruit, as it certainly
is in such extreme sorts as Snowball and Indian Cling, but it is doubtful
whether this correlation goes further than groups and even here does not
always hold. Stipules offer no distinguishing marks of importance.</p>

<p>Much use is made in classifying peaches of the presence or absence,
the size, color, shape, position and number of glands on the base of the leaf
or on the leaf-stalk. These glands may be either stalked or sessile. The
terms used in describing glands are easily understood and need no definition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
unless it be a few words in regard to the shape. Globose glands are small
globes, reniform glands are kidney-shaped. In determining the form of
glands examinations must be made several times in the season, the end
of the summer offering the best opportunity and even then care must be
taken to secure old leaves. Glands are less variable in adult trees than in
trees not yet in bearing. Pomologists for a hundred years have noted the
fact that peaches with glandless leaves are very susceptible to mildew.
We find this to be the case on the grounds of this Station. This correlation
between glandlessness and mildew may account for the fact that
peaches with glandless leaves are rapidly disappearing from American
peach-lists. Wickson says it has been found that peaches with glandless
leaves resist leaf-curl.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>Gregory has made a careful study of the glands on peach-leaves.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> We
publish here the most important facts he brings out.</p>

<p>"In a large number of cases the glands are stable and can be safely
used to aid in the identification of certain varieties. There are also varieties
in which the glands are exceptionally unstable, being on the border line
between the two types&mdash;reniform and globose&mdash;and having what might
be termed mixed glands. These mixed glands are of two kinds: one in
which the majority of the glands are reniform, with some globose intermingled;
the other in which the globose form predominates. It would be
quite possible, as Carriere (1867) suggests, to distinguish a third type of
glands&mdash;the mixed type.</p>

<p>It is important that leaves should be chosen from healthy branches
on bearing trees. It is also best to obtain a large number of leaves or to
examine the tree carefully before making the final selection of leaves.
Mature leaves are best because their glands are full-sized and correctly
shaped, while on young leaves the form of the glands is usually obscure.
This is particularly true of the reniform glands. On the other hand, old,
partly decayed, globose glands frequently have much the appearance of
reniform glands.</p>

<p>The structure of the glands shows that they are true glands, having
an upper layer of long, rectangular, secretory cells that produce a sweet
substance, the function of which is not apparent. After the glands have
ceased secreting they begin to decay, becoming brown on the upper surface
and slowly disappearing until almost nothing is left. This decaying is
a very complicated process, being preceded in every case by a suberization
and thickening of the cell walls.</p>

<p>"The spines of the leaf are very similar to the glands in structure,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
having the same upper layer of long cells, but with much more heavily
cutinized walls. A study of the transitional forms indicates that the
glands are merely modified leaf spines.</p>

<p>The leaves with reniform glands are apparently the highest type
and the glandless leaves the lowest, with the transition through the globose
type. In support of this view is the fact that whenever typically glandless
leaves become possessed of glands they are always of the globose type.</p>

<p>The serrations of the glandless leaves are very strikingly different
from those on a leaf with glands. The former leaves are deeply and doubly
serrate, while the margins of the latter are always single and crenate.
Almost invariably, when glands develop on a normally glandless leaf, the
serrations are transformed to crenations, indicating that there is a very
close correlation between the glands and the crenations on the edges of the
leaves."</p>

<p>The French pomologists, Poiteau and Turpin,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> seem to have first
made note of the glands in describing peaches, recording their discovery
by M. Desprez in the nurseries at the Luxembourg in 1810, after which,
for a half-century, French, English and German pomologists regarded
them as an infallible means of distinguishing varieties. But, by the middle
of the Nineteenth Century, classifiers began to give them up because of
their variability on leaves of trees of the same variety or even on the same
tree. Even Darwin made note of their insufficiency in taxonomic work.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
Now, no one familiar with any considerable number of varieties of peaches
would attach very great importance to glands in a system of classification.</p>

<p>The flowers of peaches are very characteristic, helping to delineate
the groups in the several classificatory schemes of various pomologists and
being ample to identify not a few varieties. Peach-flowers differ in time of
appearance; in length of blooming-season; they may be large, medium or
small; pink, rose and rarely white; borne on pedicels of varying length,
thickness, color and pubescence; and both the floral and reproductive
organs have modifications of their several structures. The size, color and
shape of peach-flowers are well shown in the first six color-plates. In
some species of Prunus, as some of the plums, the reproductive organs
differ greatly in ability to perform their functions, but the blossoms of
edible peaches are seemingly always self-fertile and there are less often the
mal-formations found in the reproductive organs of some plums.</p>

<p>A well-marked correlation<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> between the color in the inside of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
calyx-cup and the color of the flesh of the fruit is one of the distinguishing
features of peaches. Yellow-fleshed peaches develop from blossoms in
which the inside color of the calyx-cup is orange; white-fleshed peaches
develop from those in which the color is greenish or greenish-yellow sometimes
approaching a very light orange easily distinguished from the dark
orange of the other group. Since the discovery of this correlation in the
Station orchards by Mr. Charles Tubergen it has been in yearly use and
has enabled us to tell a year or two in advance the flesh-color of seedling
peaches, since the first peach-blossoms seldom set fruit.</p>

<p>The fruits, however, furnish by far the best characters upon which
to found a classification of peaches. The simplest classification of peaches
begins by separating them into smooth-skinned and pubescent sorts; each
of these divisions is redivided into clingstones and freestones; these four
groups may then be separated into yellow-fleshed, white-fleshed and
red-fleshed peaches; still further, most, not all, of the twelve groups made
in the first three divisions, separate into round, flat or beaked peaches.
These are the major characters of the fruits, little influenced by cultivation
or environment, after which there are many minor characters such as
size, shape, color, quality and season, all very responsive to changed conditions,
that help to describe definitely the many varieties of <i>Prunus
persica</i>. The most variable of the minor characters is shape, all peaches
tending to lose rotundity in southern climates and to become oblong and
beaked. The length and quantity of the pubescence on peaches vary
considerably in different soils&mdash;the warmer and lighter the soil, the less
pubescence. The skin adheres closely to the flesh in some varieties; in
others it is non-adherent.</p>

<p>The characters found in the stones of the many species of Prunus
are of great value in determining species but they help but little in determining
the horticultural varieties of any one species. The stones of the
peach do vary, however, very materially in size, shape, grooves and ridges,
pitting and in characteristics at base and apex. The color-plates in this
text illustrate these differences very well. One may generalize and say
that the stones of the freestones are more deeply furrowed and that the
sides are smoother than in the clingstones.</p>

<p>The characters of the peach are set forth on the opposite page by
reproducing a description as made at this Station in describing a variety
for <i>The Peaches of New York</i>. Such a description is, however, but a skeleton,
as dead as dry bones, unless a living picture of the variety be made by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
filling out and covering the skeleton with ample remarks made as the
describer studies the plant in the field.</p>

<p>The characters given in the foregoing description are those of the
cultivated peach&mdash;the consummate fruit of <i>Prunus persica</i>. The generic
name, Prunus, is the ancient Latin name of the plum, <i>Prunus domestica</i>,
the type species. The specific name, <i>persica</i>, commemorates the old
belief that the peach came from Persia. The common name, peach, in
English, as in most European languages, is a derivative from <i>persica</i>.
Amygdalus, found several times in the synonomy, is the Syrian name of
the almond. The drupe-fruits are put in two, three and sometimes four
genera by various botanists but in the fruit-books issued by this Station,
following most botanists and pomologists, all are put in a single genus,
Prunus. Such lumping of several distinct fruits into one genus has its
disadvantages but the several fruits cannot be reasonably separated because
outliers closely connect all. Hybridization between the cultivated stone-fruits
adds to the perplexities of classification.</p>

<p><i>Prunus persica</i> is variously divided by botanists and pomologists.
Quite commonly two botanical varieties of edible peaches are split off,
as shown in the synonomy, to separate the nectarine and the flat peaches
from the pubescent and globular peaches. But these sub-species, originating
over and over in the case of the nectarine as a bud or seed-mutation
and the flat peaches probably having originated as a mutation, are not
more distinct from the parent species than the red-fleshed sorts, the snowball
peaches, the Yellow Transvaals from South Africa, the nippled peach,
the cleft peach, the beaked peach, the winter peaches of China, or the
pot-grown dwarfs from China; in fact, are not more different from other
peaches than a clingstone is from a freestone, a yellow flesh from a white
flesh or a large-flowered from a small-flowered sort. All constitute merely
pomological groups, which, more and more, are becoming interminably
confused by hybridization.

<p>We name but one sub-species of <i>Prunus persica</i>, and that doubtful.
Mr. Frank N. Meyer of the United States Department of Agriculture has
recently introduced into the United States cuttings of a wild peach from
the province of Kansu, China, which he thinks has horticultural value.
The peach is <i>Prunus persica potanini</i> Batalin (<i>Act. Hort. Petrop.</i> <b>12</b>:164.
1892) which Mr. Meyer describes as follows:<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>"A wild peach of the <i>davidiana</i> type, but differing from it in various
points. Collected at the base of sheltered mountains at an elevation of
4300 feet. A tall shrub or even small tree, up to 30 feet in height, bark
of stem or trunk dark reddish-brown and quite smooth in the younger
shoots; leaves like those of <i>Amygdalus davidiana</i> but often broader in the
middle and always less pointed. Fruits of round-elongated form; skin
covered with a heavy down, no edible flesh; stones of elliptical shape, grooves
longer than in <i>A. davidiana</i>, shells very hard and thick, kernels elongated
and relatively small. Found growing at elevations from 4000 to 7000
feet, in side valleys away from the Siku river; thrives especially well in
sheltered and warm mountain pockets. Of value especially as a stock
for stone-fruits and possibly able to stand even more dry heat than
<i>A. davidiana</i>; also recommended as an ornamental spring-flowering tree,
especially for the drier parts of the United States. Chinese name <i>Mao t'ao</i>,
meaning 'hairy peach.'"</p>

<p>There are many ornamental forms of the peach-tree&mdash;sorts with single
or double flowers, white, pink or red in color, normal, red or variegated
foliage and standard or dwarf trees. The best-known named ornamental
peaches are <i>camelliaeflora</i> with large, carmine flowers and its sub-variety,
<i>plena</i>, with double flowers; <i>versicolor</i> with different colored flowers on
branches of the same tree; <i>atropurpurea</i> with brownish-red foliage; <i>foliis
rubris</i>, similar or possibly the same as the preceding, the color in both
extending to the fruit; <i>magnifica</i>, a semi-double with brilliant carmine-crimson
flowers; <i>pyramidalis</i>, a pyrimidal form; <i>pendula</i>, a weeping peach;
and still others, of the distinctness of which we cannot be certain, as <i>dianthi-alba-plena</i>,
<i>rubro-plena</i>, and <i>coccineo-plena</i>. With these ornamentals we
are not to be further concerned.</p>

<p>Of Japanese garden-forms the following varieties have been described:
<i>P. Persica</i> var. <i>densa</i> Makimo <i>Tokyo Bot. Mag.</i> <b>16</b>:178. 1902. <i>P. persica</i>
var. <i>vulgaris</i>, f. <i>stellata</i> Makimo l. c. <b>22</b>:119. 1908. <i>P. Persica</i> var.
<i>vulgaris</i>, f. <i>praematura</i> Makimo l. c. <b>22</b>:119. 1908.</p>

<p>Species are but convenient groups, their limits reflecting the judgment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of the species-maker. Were the authors of this text to divide <i>Prunus
persica</i>, the cleavage lines would be other than those indicated in the foregoing
paragraphs. <i>Prunus persica</i> might be divided, though there is no
intention of furthering confusion by the addition of new names, into two
species. One would include the white-fleshed, clingstone peaches, with
large flowers and calyx greenish-yellow inside; the other the yellow-fleshed,
freestone peaches, with small flowers and calyx-cups orange
inside. Primitive forms in China indicate such a division, the evolution
of varieties suggests it and the present disposition of the characters named
as separating these theoretical species attest the reasonableness of such a
separation. The primitive forms have been described and the descent
of varieties may be traced in the last two chapters, so that we need only
amplify the statement as to the present disposition of characters.</p>

<p>The characters in the two hypothetical species have been thoroughly
shuffled by hybridization but even if there is not correlation, as there
certainly is between color in calyx-cup and color of flesh, it might be
expected that those associated in the primitive plant, the Adam of the race,
would, despite the shuffling, still be most often associated. What are the
facts? In the Station orchard are 109 white-fleshed peaches; 40 per ct.
of these are semi-cling or clingstones leaving 60 per ct. nearly or quite free
(there is constant selection for freestones); 64 per ct. have large flowers;
all have calyx-cups yellowish-green inside. There are in this orchard
106 yellow-fleshed peaches; but 17 per ct. of these are cling or semi-cling,
the remainder being either quite free or nearly so; 73 per ct. have small
or medium-sized flowers; all have calyx-cups deeply colored with orange
inside.</p>

<p>Similarities in characters indicate so close a relationship between the
almond and the peach that one might well suspect many hybrids between
the two. Yet there appear to be but few clear cases of peach and almond
crosses. Knight<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> reports crossing the two, the doubtful results of which
led him to believe, as we have seen, that the peach is but a modified almond.
Several such crosses are indicated in botanical literature<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> but whether all
refer to one or several supposed crosses there is no way of knowing&mdash;probably
to one. The almond blooms so much earlier than the peach
that crosses could hardly occur in nature. A hybrid between the two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
from which could be evolved a late-blooming almond is a consummation
to be wished.</p>

<h3>THE NECTARINE</h3>

<p>The nectarine is a hairless peach. The tree differs in no respect from
that of the peach and besides the absence of pubescence the only other
distinguishing marks between the fruits are smaller size, firmer flesh, greater
aroma and a distinct and richer flavor in nectarines. Even the varieties
of the two fruits correspond in characters. Thus, there are clingstone and
freestone sorts of each; both may have red, yellow, or white flesh; the
flowers of both may be large or small; nectarine leaves, in one variety or
another, show all the variations in glands and serrations known to the
peach; and the stones and kernels are indistinguishable. There seem to
be no records so far, however, of flat or beaked nectarines, abnormalities
each represented in several varieties of peaches. The two fruits are adapted
to the same soil and climatic conditions and wherever the peach is grown,
the world over, the nectarine is found.</p>

<p>The established history of the nectarine goes back 2000 years and
then merges into that of the peach. Despite the fact that De Candolle<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
"sought in vain for a proof that the nectarine existed in Italy in the time
of ancient Rome," we are convinced that Pliny's "duracinus" is the
nectarine. Matthiolus<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> in 1554 discusses Pliny's statements concerning
the kinds of peaches at length and concludes that the author's "duracinus"
is the peach. Dalechamp, in 1587, and J. Bauhin, in 1650, both describe
nectarines after which botanists and pomologists invariably include this
fruit. In the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries the nectarine was
called "nucipersica" because it resembled in smoothness and color of the
outer skin as well as in size and shape, the walnut. "Nectarine," the
meaning of the word obvious, appears first to have been used for this fruit,
in the English language at least, by Parkinson in 1629 who describes six
varieties<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> and gives us the information "they have been with us not many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
years." Gerarde, the great English herbalist, 1597, does not mention them.
We find the nectarine first mentioned in America in 1722 by Robert Beverly
in his <i>History of Virginia</i>, who, after discussing the culture of peaches,
nectarines and apricots, says (pages 259, 260): "Peaches and nectarines
I believe to be spontaneous, somewhere or other on that continent, for the
Indians have, and ever had greater variety, and finer sorts of them than the
English."</p>

<p>The nectarine is one of the most interesting phenomena in horticulture.
It is the classical example of bud- and seed-variation, furnishing more
instances of mutation, and these more instructive, than have yet come from
any other fruit. Darwin, with the magnificent exhaustiveness which
characterized his method, brought together in <i>Animals and Plants under
Domestication</i><a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> a striking array of facts which leaves nothing to be added
as to the manner in which the peach and nectarine are reciprocally reproduced
the one from the other. He shows by numerous examples: (1)
That nectarines may spring from peach-stones and peaches from nectarine-stones.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
(2) That peach-trees produce nectarines by bud-variation and
nectarine-trees likewise produce peaches, and that either the nectarines or
peaches so arising will come true to seed. (3) That either peach or
nectarine-trees may produce individual fruits half-nectarine and half-peach.
(4) A case is cited of a nectarine tree bearing a half-and-half fruit
and subsequently a true peach.</p>

</div>

<p>It must be noted that in all of the variations so far recorded there
are no intermediate forms between the two fruits. The peach produced
in these bud-variations is a peach and nothing but a peach; the nectarine,
a nectarine and nothing but a nectarine. Even in those remarkable
phenomena, of which several are recorded, in which the fruits are divided
into halves or quarters, one or more segments being peach and one or more
nectarine, there can be no mistake as to peach and nectarine in pubescence,
color or flavor. The nectarine from the peach, thus becomes as clear-cut
a case of discontinuous variation as can be. If we accept the mutation
theory of the origin of species&mdash;new species arising suddenly at a single
step&mdash;the nectarine is a species in process of birth.</p>

<p>As yet we are entirely ignorant in regard to the conditions under which
the peach or the nectarine sports, the one producing the other. It is wholly
a natural phenomenon, for no one has been able to cause the peach to
produce the hairless form or the nectarine to bring forth a downy fruit.
The relations of the two fruits have furnished a fertile field of inquiry for
over a century but the problem is one of those mysterious ones in which
there are many facts that cannot be fitted into a theory, so that our ignorance
is as profound now as ever. There are, however, several theories
which, without going into full detail, need to be stated.</p>

<p>The oldest notion is that the production of a nectarine on a peach-tree
is due to the direct action of pollen from some nearby nectarine-tree
on the ovary of the peach. This theory, wholly at variance with present
knowledge, is also discredited by the many instances in which the sports
occur when the two fruits are not growing in the same neighborhood
or even region. Thus, within ten years, several cases of nectarines on
peach-trees have occurred in this State where the nectarine is scarcely
known. Besides, crossing these fruits shows no direct effect of pollen&mdash;as
is true with nearly all other plants. Still further, when a branch of a
peach has borne a nectarine it usually goes on year after year producing
nectarines; and certainly impregnation of a flower by foreign pollen could
not so profoundly modify a branch. There is so little foundation for this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
belief that it would not be mentioned were it not that many fruit-growers
still look to the action of pollen as the explanation of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Another, and a much more probable explanation, is that every sporting
peach or nectarine-tree is a more or less remote hybrid. There is
a growing belief that species are fixed and that crossing is the only source
of new seed- or bud-forms. Certainly all who have crossed plants in any
considerable numbers know that hybridity is at least one cause, and a
frequent one, of mutations. It is possible that sometime in the past the
peach and the nectarine were crossed, the offspring showing no trace of the
cross, and that now there is an occasional disassociation of the characters
brought together by such crossing. There are several objections to this
hypothesis. One is that two forms sufficiently distinct to induce so striking
a variation as a nectarine from a peach, must have differed in tree as well
as in fruit-characters and that these differences would crop out just as
smoothness of fruit so frequently does. Another, and less potent objection,
is that the nectarine has never been found wild, that it never becomes
naturalized, that it is shorter-lived and less vigorous and behaves in general
like an artificial plant.</p>

<p>The third, and at present the most acceptable theory, is that we have
in the nectarine from the peach what De Vries calls a retrogressive mutation.
That is, an active character, in this case pubescence on the fruit,
becomes latent and appears to be lost&mdash;a type of mutation frequent
among cultivated plants. The nectarine, then, is a peach with one character
subtracted. When the nectarine yields a peach, the character is
restored. The one is a negative, the other a positive step; one is retrogressive,
the other progressive mutation. The speculations as to what
causes these mutations are as yet too vague to be profitable. Probably
we can never make use of the cause by which mutations arise or of the conditions
leading to them until we can induce these strange variations.
That they are due to disturbances in the processes of cell-division is the
theory now current&mdash;sufficiently comprehensive and sufficiently vague
to be a most convenient explanation, at any rate.</p>

<p>Nectarines do not attain the perfection in New York reached west
of the Rocky Mountains. The trees, possibly, are a little less manageable
in the orchard, less vigorous and certainly more susceptible to pests.
Nectarines, in particular, suffer more than peaches from the scourge of the
crescent sign, curculio, a pest which finds all smooth-skinned stone-fruits
much to its taste and the nectarine more than others. Then, too, whether
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
fresh, canned or dried, fruit-buyers in America prefer the peach. This
discrimination in favor of the peach is largely due to lack of knowledge of
the nectarine, which, though different from the commoner fruit, is equally
delectable, fresh or preserved, and certainly is a handsomer product preserved
either by canning or evaporating. Indeed, the dried nectarine,
with its beautiful, translucent, amber hue is the most attractive of all
cured fruits. The nectarine-industry, however, belongs to California,
where all conditions favor production, canning and curing.</p>

<p>Father David's peach, <i>Prunus davidiana</i>, has been grown in Europe
since 1865 as an ornamental, seeds of it having been sent from China to
France in that year by Father David, a missionary traveler.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> The species
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
is described as flowering in America in the Arnold Arboretum as early
as 1888,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> seeds from which the trees grew having been sent from China.
Some ten or twelve years ago the species was distributed by the United
States Department of Agriculture, trees being received at this Station in
the spring of 1906. Meanwhile, agricultural explorers representing this
country in China have discovered that the species is much used by the
Chinese as a stock upon which to work other species of Prunus. Whereupon,
new distributions were made through seeds and plants to nearly
every fruit-growing state in the Union. We are, therefore, now able to
speak of the behavior of the Davidiana peach in America with some degree
of confidence as to its future as a stock for peaches. But, first, a word as
to its habitat and uses in China.</p>

<p>The several importations of seeds recorded by the United States
Department of Agriculture seem all to have been made from the province
of Chili in China and from the cities of Pekin and Tientsin in the neighborhood
of which the tree is commonly found wild. According to Bretschneider,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>
the species was first discovered by Bunge near Peking in 1831
who took it to be an almond. The same authority says that Father David's
seeds came from wild trees growing in the mountains near Jehol, and that
the species is much cultivated in the gardens of Peking, there being two
varieties, one with rose-colored and the other with white flowers. At the
time of its introduction into Europe, it was considered, by some, the wild
form of the cultivated peach. The fruit of David's peach is not edible and
peach-growers would have but passing interest in the species as a very
attractive ornamental were it not for the fact that it is a common and
most valuable stock, used for centuries in China for several of the stone-fruits.</p>

<p>It is, then, with a view to its fitness as a stock that the Davidiana
peach must be discussed. Its characters in several respects indicate that
it may make an invaluable stock in America as it has long been in China.
For this purpose it seems possible to use it equally well for several stone-fruits.</p>

<p>As it grows on the Station grounds the most experienced fruit-grower
cannot guess whether <i>Prunus davidiana</i> is a peach, nectarine, almond,
apricot or plum. As we shall show later, too, it hybridizes with several
other species of its genus. Its similarities to all of these stone-fruits give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
a clue to its value as a stock&mdash;it may be used for all. It is the commonest
stock for all of these fruits in parts of China and is sometimes used for the
cherry as well. It is reported by the United States Department of Agriculture<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>
to have been tried in commercial plantings of peaches, plums,
apricots and almonds in California and Texas and for all is "unusually
promising."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i_086a.jpg">
<img id="i086a" src="images/i_086a.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption"><i>PRUNUS DAVIDIANA</i></p>
</div>

<p>The trees are vigorous, healthy, hardy, and resistant to drouth.  Consorted
with any stone-fruit it should impart these qualities in some degree
to the resulting tree. On the Station grounds, <i>Prunus davidiana</i> is growing
with vigor and health despite the fact that in the ten years of its existence
here we have had all but record-breaking extremes of cold, heat, drouth and
rain&mdash;a decade long to be noted for its extremes of weather. It seems
to stand the heat of Texas, and in Minnesota has withstood cold as low
as forty degrees below zero, a temperature which kills commercial varieties
to the ground. It cannot be fruited, however, in cold climates as its buds
swell quickly with rises of temperature and succumb to subsequent cold;
neither will it fruit in regions of late frost since it is one of the earliest species
in the genus Prunus to flower. In Texas and southern California, according
to the United States Department of Agriculture, it is proving resistant
to drouth and in the latter region to alkali as well. In very dry and exposed
places, it is said to lose its tree-characters and to become a thrifty shrub.</p>

<p>Present nursery practices in growing peaches are unsatisfactory in
the extreme. More and more, pits from canneries are being planted for
stocks. The pits come from a great diversity of varieties and the resulting
seedlings are variable in vigor, health, size and capacity to take the bud.
Should no unsurmountable weaknesses appear in <i>Prunus davidiana</i> it is
almost certain that its seedlings will be more satisfactory as stocks for
the peach than those from either cannery pits or from pits grown on
southern wild trees. The trees do not fruit well in this climate, even
when buds and flowers escape the cold, possibly because of infertility of
bloom, and for this reason, the chief objection so far, some favorable region
would have to be discovered in which to grow the pits.</p>

<p>As one might suspect from its similarities to the several stone-fruits,
<i>Prunus davidiana</i> gives promise of being a go-between in hybridization.
I. V. Mijurin, a noted Russian hybridist of Kozloo, Russia, has crossed the
Davidiana peach and the dwarf almond, <i>Prunus nana</i>, with the idea of
getting a hardy fruit for central Russia. The resulting offspring, according
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
to Mr. F. N. Meyer,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> looks in tree like the peach-parent but the fruit
is more like that of the almond-parent. The fruit of the hybrid is inedible
but the plant is a handsome ornamental. Mr. Mijurin states that while
neither of the two parents will hybridize with the common peach, this
hybrid does. <i>Prunus davidiana</i>, then, like the Sand Cherry of the Western
Plains, may prove to be a valuable go-between in hybridizing species of
Prunus.</p>

<p>The fruit has no comestible value. It is small, less than an inch
in diameter, nearly round, very downy, yellow at maturity, with thin,
dry, tasteless flesh which parts readily from the stone even before fully
ripe. As if to complete its worthlessness as an edible product, it begins
to shrivel as maturity approaches and soon decays. In fruit, even more
than in tree, it is an intermediate between the peach and the almond.</p>

<p>A word must be said as to the merits of <i>Prunus davidiana</i> as an ornamental.
It is the first harbinger of spring in the great family to which it
belongs, bursting into a profusion of white or pinkish flowers with the
approach of warm weather even before forsythias are in flower. Its thickly
set, erect branchlets are wands of pinkish-white two feet in length, making
a handsome tree and furnishing beautiful cut-flowers. If grown for its
flowers, however, one must be content in northern climates to have it in
bloom only about one season out of three but even so it repays culture.
The Chinese cultivate dwarf specimens, possibly a dwarf form, for winter-flowering
and the plant, it would seem, would readily lend itself to winter-forcing
in American floriculture. The tree, quite aside from its flowers,
is handsome at all times. A form with pure white flowers is a very desirable
ornamental.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> On the Station grounds this white-flowering peach has a
fastigiate habit of growth and resembles somewhat a small Lombardy
poplar.</p>

<p><i>Prunus mira</i> is a new peach discovered in China by Mr. E. H. Wilson
of the Arnold Arboretum. The foregoing technical description is a translation
from the original description by Koehne. Mr. Wilson describes
for <i>The Peaches of New York</i> the outstanding botanical and horticultural
characters of <i>Prunus mira</i> as follows:</p>

<p>"<i>Prunus mira</i> is a small bushy tree, growing about 6m. tall, with a
trunk about 1m. in girth and a crown some 8m. through. The branches
are relatively slender and the branchlets twiggy, and these, together with
the narrow, lance-shaped, long-pointed leaves, give the plant a very distinct
appearance. The fruit is roundish oval, about 4.5 cm. high and 3.5-4 cm.
broad, downy on the outside, with white flesh and a free stone. The flavor
is the same as that of fruits from the semi-wild plants of the Common Peach
(<i>P. Persica</i>). The stone is 2 to 2.2 cm. high and 1.3-1.4 cm. broad, and
in shape is flattened ovoid and pointed. The flowers are unknown
to me.</p>

<p>This plant grows wild on rather barren mountain slopes at about
3000m. altitude north of the town of Tachienlu on the China-Thibetan
borderland, where it was first detected by me on July 9, 1908, and from
whence I introduced it by means of seeds in the autumn of 1910. I saw
only a few trees, but have reason to believe that it is fairly common, and
also that it is thereabouts cultivated for its fruit. In the Arnold Arboretum
this species has proved no more hardy than the Common Peach, though
from the altitude at which it grows naturally it ought to be the hardier
plant. Our largest specimen is 2.5m. high and crown 3m. through. It
starts into growth and leafs out much later than the Common Peach, and
is therefore much less liable to be affected by late frosts. This is the one
advantage so far evident in our experience with this new Peach under
cultivation. Undoubtedly it possesses important horticultural possibilities,
and especially should it be valuable to the hybridist on account of
its small and smooth stone. Indeed, it requires no imagination to realize
the advantage to be gained by supplanting in our present day race of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
garden peaches for the large and deeply furrowed stone one that is quite
smooth and small."</p>

<p><i>Prunus mira</i> is now under cultivation at the Arnold Arboretum near
Boston, in the parks at Rochester, New York, on the grounds of this Station
and at Brookville, Florida, in charge of the United States Department of
Agriculture. No doubt within a few years we shall have positive evidence
of its horticultural value.</p>

<h3>PUBESCENT-FRUITED SPECIES OF PRUNUS FROM THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<p>Seven pubescent-fruited species of Prunus are found in the Southwestern
States. From reading the descriptions, it is hard to tell whether
these plants, unique in more than one respect, are most closely related to
peaches, plums, apricots or almonds. Professor S. C. Mason of the United
States Department of Agriculture, who has studied these fruits,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> thinks
that some if not all of them may have horticultural value, at least in the
Southwest where fluctuations of heat and cold are great and drought and
alkalinity of soil must be endured by plant-life. They deserve brief mention
in <i>The Peaches of New York</i> because of the possibility that some of them
can be used as dwarfing-stocks for the peach and possibly that some may
be hybridized with cultivated peaches. The species, with brief notes
taken for most part from Mason, are as follows:</p>

<p><i>Prunus texana</i> Dietrich, the "wild peach" of Texas, is a plum-like
fruit from eastern Texas of which there are already several hybrids with
the wild plums of the region. <i>Prunus andersonii</i> Gray is the "wild
almond" or "wild peach" of Nevada. The species is found in western
Nevada and eastern California in a region subject to severe cold in winter
and extreme drought and heat in summer. One cultivator of this species
suggests it as a good stock for the peach and the almond and thinks it has
possibilities for hybridization.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> The "desert apricot," <i>Prunus eriogyna</i>
Mason, comes from a very restricted region in southern California. The
characters of this species should fit it to endure the environment on the
desert slopes of mountains. The "desert almond," <i>Prunus fasciculata</i>
Torrey, sometimes called "wild peach" and "wild almond," ranges much
farther south and east than <i>Prunus andersonii</i> in southern Nevada and
southern California, crossing into southwestern Utah and northwestern
Arizona, and grows in gravels and sands where its roots penetrate to great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
depth. <i>Prunus minutiflora</i> Engelman, the "Texas almond," is found in
southwestern Texas, a shrub which, like the former species and the one
following, is dioecious, a marked and unique peculiarity of these three
species. The "Mexican almond," <i>Prunus microphylla</i> Hemsley, is found
in the high mountain region of Mexico. <i>Prunus havardii</i> Wight, is known
only in a restricted region in western Texas. The last two species are so
little known that one cannot even surmise whether they may have
horticultural possibilities.</p>

<h3>HORTICULTURAL CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE PEACH</h3>

<p>The opening years of the Nineteenth Century mark the first attempts
at classifying peaches. By 1818 as many as three classificatory schemes
had been proposed, all being modifications of the same general arrangement.
July 7, 1818, John Robertson read a paper on classifying peaches
and nectarines before the Horticultural Society of London. Later, this
was printed in the Transactions of the Society<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> together with a classification
by M. Poiteau from the <i>Bon Jardinier</i> and another by Count Lelieur
from his <i>Pomone Francaise</i>. In January, 1824, George Lindley read before
the same society a classification which was but an extension of the older
arrangements.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>Robertson separated peaches into true peaches and nectarines and
these in turn into Classes, Divisions and Sub-divisions. He founded the
two classes on the presence or absence of glands; for each of his classes
he made two divisions distinguished by the size and color of the flowers;
each of the four divisions is once redivided into a sub-division in which
the flesh parts from the stone and another in which the flesh adheres to the
stone. The two French writers use the same characters but found their
second division on the adherence or non-adherence of the flesh to the
stone; their third on the size of the flower but making three partitions as
to size; and their fourth on the presence or absence of glands which they
divide into globose and reniform. Lindley created three classes dependent
on the presence or absence and the character of the glands and the character
of the serrations; three divisions of each class in accordance as to
whether the flowers are large, medium-sized or small; two sub-divisions of
each division to agree with the presence or absence of down; and for each
sub-division two sections, one for clingstones and one for melters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>This was the age of the classifier and other classifications, all similar
in plan, rapidly followed in England, France, Belgium and Germany. No
one at this time seems to have attempted a natural classification of
peaches.</p>

<p>Of the nine leading American pomological writers of the Nineteenth
Century, Coxe, Prince, Cole, Hooper, Elliott and Barry either do not
attempt to classify or make but one or two simple divisions. Kenrick,
1832, follows Lindley in part but makes use of season in his classification.
Downing in his first edition, 1845, divides peaches into freestones with
pale flesh, freestones with deep yellow flesh and clingstones. This simple
arrangement by Downing is notable only because it is the first time color
of flesh is made use of as a distinguishing mark, the Europeans probably
not having done so because yellow-fleshed varieties are rare in Europe
whereas in America they are as common or more so than white-fleshed
sorts. Thomas, in 1846, did not classify but in later editions divided peaches
into two divisions, founded on adherence of flesh to the stone; two classes
for each division in accordance with color of flesh; and three sections founded
on leaf-serrations and glands.</p>

<p>These Nineteenth Century classifications are artificial. That is,
they single out a few points of resemblance and difference and arrange
varieties in accordance with them, convenience and facility of use being the
controlling principles. They are natural to a degree, however, because
varieties agreeing in one point of structure commonly agree in other characters.
With the peach, more than in the artificial classification of most
other fruits, the characters are readily distinguished and are stable. Yet
most English pomologies now arrange varieties of peaches alphabetically,
while the American texts do the same or use the pseudo-natural system
of Onderdonk. His classification we are about to discuss. The early
artificial arrangements failed to stand the test of time because classifiers
could not agree upon any one arrangement and added confusion by the
multiplicity of them; and, because the new varieties of the last half-century,
coming in great numbers, are so poorly described that the great majority
of them could not be classified from the data at hand.</p>

<p>In 1887 Gilbert Onderdonk,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> a special agent of the United States
Department of Agriculture, published a natural classification of peaches.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
He put varieties of peaches into five groups which he called races and
to which he gave the names: Persian, Northern Chinese, Spanish, Southern
Chinese and Peento. He bounded peach-culture in America on the
north by the Great Lakes and on the south by the Gulf and divided this
great region into five zones to each of which he assigned one of his races.
Onderdonk studied peaches in Texas and found there remarkable distinguishing
characters; as, in adaptations to southern climates, in length
of the rest-period, in differences in leafing, blooming and fruiting-time,
and in the organs of the plants. Professor R. H. Price, working with a
large number of varieties at the Texas Agricultural College, verified and
greatly extended Onderdonk's observations.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> Eventually, Price became
the pontifical authority in this country on the classification of peaches
and in numerous articles and addresses set forth the Onderdonk grouping
of varieties so convincingly that it was adopted by practically all American
pomologists and at present is in use, to some degree at least, in nearly all
of our horticultural literature. It becomes necessary, therefore, to scrutinize
closely this natural classification of Onderdonk and Price.</p>

<p>The end to be attained in a classification of peaches, as in classifying
natural objects of any kind, is to provide an epitome of the knowledge
of the fruits classified. Incidentally, a classification helps in the identification
of varieties of peaches. Does the Onderdonk classification serve
these purposes? We have not found that it does. In most arduous
attempts to arrange the sorts of peaches growing on the Station grounds
according to the Onderdonk plan, we have wholly failed. Even the varieties
named as types do not fit, as they grow in the north, in the places provided
for them by these southern classifiers. Indeed, we have wasted so
much time and patience in attempting to group varieties according to
Onderdonk and Price, and with so little success, that the Onderdonk
classification seems to us to be cursed with the confusion of Babel. Since
pomologists so generally accept this classification, these words demand
that it be shown wherein this attempt at a natural arrangement of varieties
fails.</p>

<p>In the first place the basis of Onderdonk's classification, as the names
suggest, is regional variation. Each race stands for a region, the Peento
included&mdash;for the name is very obviously Chinese. Incompleteness, then,
is the first fault of this system for there are other regions in which races of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
peaches just as distinct as those named have developed: as, for examples,
the Bokhara represents a hardy "Russian race;" Yellow Transvaal belongs
to the very peculiar "South African race;" in the rich alluvial lands of
Egypt, the "Egyptian race" has developed; still another regional race is
found in the evergreen peach of the West Indies. We have no doubt
that distinct races of peaches may have originated or will arise in the
Canary Islands, Hawaii, New Zealand, Argentina, Chili and Mexico, to
mention only countries spoken of in the foregoing pages. The Onderdonk
classification can, of course, be extended to take in these new races, most of
which are now represented in America, but eventually such a classification
would become too cumbersome for use. It must not be overlooked that
the Onderdonk classification should be doubled to apply to the nectarine,
the other division of <i>Prunus persica</i>, which the present classification wholly
ignores.</p>

<p>If the variations are stable, and all regions represented, the likenesses
and differences brought about by regional environment may well be used
by classifiers. But in the Onderdonk classification unstable variations
due to climate are too largely used; as, differences in the succession of life-events,
in the rest-period, in the capacity to endure heat and drought, and
in minor modifications of organs, as color of foliage and shape of fruit.
All of these are variations that fluctuate with even slight changes in the
climate. We have said that this classification, though constantly referred
to by northern fruit-growers, is not satisfactory in New York. Professor
Price, too, found as he went northward that his classificatory scheme was
less dependable. He says:<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> "Some of the distinctions made in this classification
cannot be noticed with decisive clearness a few hundred miles farther
north." A further objection to this regional classification of Onderdonk
is that, in the numerous distinct peach-regions of America, new regional
variations are arising which make it impossible to classify in accordance
with characters that appeared before the peach came to America.</p>

<p>These "races" of Onderdonk and Price, then, by leaving out the
peach-floras of many regions, are too exclusive, but it is no less true that
they are too inclusive. Thus, the many varieties of the historic peach of
western countries are put by the Onderdonk classification in the Persian
race. So considered, this Persian race contains types quite as widely
separated from each other as are the five "races" of the Onderdonk classification.
In one great group are collected early, late, white-fleshed, yellow-fleshed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
red-fleshed, globular, oblong, beaked, hardy and tender, vigorous
and dwarfish peaches. Persian peaches run the whole gamut of peach-characters,
the flatness of the Peento possibly excepted, and from the
several hundred sorts a score of "races" might be made. These peaches
are noted by Price and Onderdonk as requiring a long period of rest and as
succeeding only in northern climates. Yet to this group belong the peaches
of France, Spain and Italy; those of the warm parts of Africa, South America
and Oceanica; and most of the varieties that thrive at the most northern
limits of peach-growing in Europe and America.</p>

<p>The Onderdonk classification, in assigning zones to each of its five
races, misleads peach-growers as to the hardiness of varieties. It makes
the Peento and honey-flavored peaches much more tender in tree than they
are. Varieties of both groups grow as far north as this Station and Waugh
reports that one of the Peento varieties "was discovered growing thriftily
and fruiting nicely on the grounds of the Massachusetts Agricultural
College, Amherst, Massachusetts."<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> Of the score of descendants of the
Honey, several are fruiting well on our grounds, four being illustrated and
described in <i>The Peaches of New York</i>. If there were a demand for honey-flavored
peaches, climate would not prevent their culture in New York.</p>

<p>The name used for the Peento group, if it be worth while keeping
these peaches in a group, is inapt. It gives the impression that all, like
Peento, are flat peaches&mdash;in fact Price several times so publishes them&mdash;whereas
of the twenty-three sorts described by Hume,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> though nearly all
are seedlings of Peento, only Peento is flat. We must look upon the
Peento as a peach-monster similar to the cleft peach, <i>Emperor of Russia</i>,
the nippled peach, <i>Teton de Venus</i>, the <i>Perseque</i> with its teat-like protuberances,
or the more familiar snow-white and blood-red varieties.</p>

<p>We are not able to see where the Peento group leaves off and the Honey
group begins in the Onderdonk classification, though, since varieties of the
Peentos have not fruited at Geneva and the several Honey-flavored
peaches, though both thrifty in tree and fruitful, are possibly not typical,
we ought not to be too critical. As we read the descriptions made by
others, however, we are struck by the fact that there are more similarities
than differences in the two groups and that the differences are rapidly
disappearing through hybridization.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>But the obstacle which most effectually blocks the use of Onderdonk's
classification in the systematic arrangement of peaches is the brood of
hybrid seedling peaches annually brought forth by fruit-growers. No
doubt the classification is workable, to a degree, with the type-varieties and
a few carefully selected progeny but after the practical peach-grower,
with a devil-may-care attitude toward classification, crosses and recrosses
the types, the several races become hopelessly interlocked. The characters
chiefly used by Onderdonk, as has been said, are fluctuating variations
and these do not descend according to Mendelian laws. And so the great
out-pouring of varieties during the past quarter-century has literally
swamped a classification which served only fairly well when it included
but the pioneer varieties. In the trituration of the thousand and more
varieties of peaches now going on, the Onderdonk classification will be less
and less useful.</p>

<p>In dismissing the Onderdonk scheme as having but limited application
for classificatory purposes, acknowledgment is made that it serves other
purposes very well. It calls attention to the history of the peach; it shows
that racial strains of the peach are arising; it brings out valuable information
in regard to hardiness and the rest-period of peaches; it offers instances
of modification of the peach by climate; and it shows the capacity of the
peach to vary. For thus illuminating the natural history of the peach,
more especially the climatology of the peach, pomology is much indebted
to Onderdonk and Price.</p>

<p><i>A key to varieties of peaches.</i>&mdash;A natural classification of peaches to
show the relationships of varieties is seemingly impossible. The deluge
of new varieties, which growers continue with cheerful optimism to pour
out, overwhelms the classifier with difficulties. About the best that can
be done is to arrange varieties, for convenience in identifying, according
to some of the artificial systems of a century ago when the cult of the
classifier was at its height. These were really synoptical keys rather than
biological classifications. If such a key is to be used very generally by
fruit-growers, only characters of the fruit are admissible, thereby attaining
necessary simplicity and providing that all data can be had at one
examination.</p>

<p>The first division of a synoptical key would of course be founded on
the absence or presence of pubescence on the skin; these two great divisions
would then be separated into freestones and clingstones; these, in turn,
divided in accordance to color of flesh&mdash;white, yellow, red; the Peento and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
honey-flavored peaches make necessary a division in regard to shape&mdash;globular,
flat, beaked; a further separation into early, medium and late sorts
could then be made. A great merit in this extremely simple classification
is that the language of the layman fits it. As examples: Greensboro would
follow the key from bottom to top&mdash;an early, round, white-fleshed, freestone
peach; or Salwey, a late, round, yellow-fleshed, freestone peach.
This key provides for seventy-two groups, fifty-four for the peach and
eighteen for the nectarine, the latter having but the globular form. Other
characters, of less general application in the key than those so far used,
as size, flavor, adherence or non-adherence of the skin, suture, apex, and
stone, could be used to carry this classification still further.

<small>COMMERCIAL PEACH-GROWING IN AMERICA</small></h2>

<p>Commercial peach-growing began in America early in the Nineteenth
Century. About this time, it will be remembered, budded trees began to
take the place of seedlings. Named varieties appeared as a consequence
of budding and, as nurseries sprang up in the settled parts of the country,
varieties multiplied at a rapid rate. After the year 1800 we read less about
peaches as food for hogs and less about peach-products for assuaging the
thirst for strong drink. As cities and towns built up, market demands
increased and money-making began to quicken the charms of peach-growing.
With the coming of extensive plantings and intensive culture in
commercial orchards, new and menacing pests and other problems began
to appear at every turn. Before the middle of the century, commercial
peach-growing was in full swing in the Chesapeake peach-belt and in its
infancy in several westward regions. Stories of great success now filled
the papers, "peach kings" abounded, and, with the return of good times
following the Civil War, fruit-growers indulged in a saturnalia of peach-tree
planting. The rouge of speculation made the industry doubly attractive.
An account of the rise of commercial peach-growing in America
cannot help but be of interest and, besides, it is only by the study of the
past of the industry that we can draw safe conclusions for the future.</p>

<p>Peach-growing on a commercial scale in the United States began in
what is known as the Peninsula, consisting, technically, of the Eastern
Shore of Maryland, Delaware and southern New Jersey but horticulturally,
because of similitude of soil, climate and products, taking in a bit of Virginia,
touching eastern Pennsylvania and running up to Long Island.
All of this region, including the southern reaches of the Hudson, may be
considered as one commercial territory. The peach began its undisputed
supremacy among fruits in the orchards of the Peninsula as early
as orchards were planted but, beginning with 1800, the industry pushed
ahead with leaps and bounds so that the figures at times remind one of
Alice in Wonderland when she drank from the magic bottle and immediately
grew to gigantic proportions.</p>

<p>In 1800 an orchard of 20,000 trees was set in Anne Arundel County,
Maryland, the product to be used in brandy-making.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> The last peach-grower
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
to engage in the liquor business seems to have been a certain Mr.
Bayley in Accomack County, Virginia, the tip of the Peninsula, who in
1814 planted 63,000 trees which six years later yielded fifteen gallons of
brandy per 100 trees, worth $2 per gallon&mdash;not profitable unless the
seed were sown in rows, as was probably the case, and the seedlings permitted
to crowd rather closely.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> One of the first large orchards planted
in this region to supply city peach-markets was that of a Mr. Cassidy who
set an orchard of 50,000 trees in Cecil County, Maryland, about 1830.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
The product of this orchard went to market in sailboats and large wagons.
The industry was not in full swing in this region until the fifties when
orchards were planted all along the water courses in Cecil, Kent and Queen
Anne counties, making a continuous forest of peach-trees two miles back
from the rivers.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p>The peach-industry in Delaware seems to have begun, according to Mr.
Charles Wright,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> in 1832 at Delaware City, when a twenty-acre orchard of
budded trees was set by Messrs. Reeves and Ridgeway, which by 1836 had
increased to 110 acres. The receipts from this orchard in a single season were
as much as $16,000, the fruit bringing in Philadelphia from $1.25 to $3 per
three-peck basket. Other notable orchards of these early times mentioned
by Mr. Wright are those of Major Philip Reybold and Sons who, beginning
in 1835, by 1846 had 117,720 trees on 1090 acres near Delaware City
from which 63,344 baskets of peaches were shipped in August, 1845; in
Kent County, John Reed began planting as early as 1829 and several years
later had 10,000 trees of Red Cheek Melocotons. In 1848 the peach-crop
in Delaware was estimated at 5,000,000 baskets, chiefly from New
Castle County. Peach-yellows, first a serious pest around Philadelphia
about 1800, became epidemic in northern Delaware in 1842 and, little by
little, the center of the peach-industry shifted southward from Middletown
in the late sixties to Smyrna; a few years later it had reached Wyoming
and in the nineties it was as far south as Bridgeville.</p>

<p>It is interesting to follow the ups and downs of the peach-industry
in the Peninsula. Epidemics of yellows, a succession of cold winters,
over-production, transportation difficulties or expense, San Jose scale,
have all been factors powerful enough at various times to make or mar the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
fortunes of those engaged in growing peaches. Indeed, in following the
history of this fruit on the Peninsula, one is forced to declare that peach-growing
is gambling pure and simple. Take, for example, the building
of the Delaware railroad. Peaches were scarcely planted in the interior
parts of the Peninsula, away from water-ways, until the building of this
road in the sixties and seventies, when the yield increased so rapidly that
4,175,500 baskets were shipped by rail in 1875, the total yield being 8,782,716
baskets<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a>&mdash;fortunes followed the completion of the railroad only to be
lost in subsequent over-production.</p>

<p>New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, and southeastern New York rather
slowly followed the lead of Delaware in commercial peach-growing. New
Jersey, according to census reports, reached her zenith in peach-growing in
1899 when there were 4,413,568 peach-trees in the State which produced
2,746,607 bushels of fruit giving her third rank among the states of the
Union in production. Ten years later the State had dropped to fourteenth.
The peach seems to have been neglected in eastern Pennsylvania as a
commercial crop, possibly because a good start was never made on account
of the early appearance of yellows. In southeastern New York and on
Long Island, peach-growers have usually followed the fortunes of their
neighbors in New Jersey who have ever grown on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>To show how quickly the peach gives returns and how great the return
from the capital invested, the following figures, savoring a good deal of
American boastfulness of dollars and cents, are illustrative:<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> "The peach
farms in Upper Delaware and Maryland have returned to their owners
the most fabulous amounts for their investments far exceeding in profit
any other staple crop that has been raised in the Middle States, and on a
scale never before heard of in this or any other country. Some of the
orchards containing from 1000 to 1300 acres have netted their owners from
$20,000 to $30,000 annually. A peach orchard in New Castle county,
Delaware, of 400 acres, netted the owner in one crop, $38,000. One in
Kent county, Maryland, of some 600 acres, produced a crop paying $31,000,
and the same orchard in 1879 yielded $42,000. In 1873, the Delaware
Peach Growers' Association reported that there were sent from the
Delaware peninsula to the northern markets of Philadelphia and New
York 1,288,500 baskets of peaches, or 2577 car-loads by the railroad.
Adding the quantity shipped by steamers and sailing vessels, and the
amount canned, the actual quantity amounted, in the aggregate, to
2,000,000 of baskets. In 1872, the whole district, comprising the Eastern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
Shore of Maryland, marketed 3,500,000 baskets. The late Col. Wilkins,
on Chester river, Kent county, Maryland, had 1350 acres in with peach
trees, numbering 137,000, producing in bearing years from $30,000 to
$40,000 annually."</p>

<p>Commercial peach-growing in the South is of recent development&mdash;its
history is known to all pomologists of the present generation. It began
in the seventies, the impetus being given by the introduction of a number
of early, bright-colored, very showy peaches that could be marketed in
northern cities in May and June. It took years, however, to develop means
to send these peaches to market and it was not until in the nineties that the
perfection of refrigerator cars and rapid transportation was such that the
southern crop cut any figure in the peach-markets. The introduction
of the Elberta in the seventies may be said to be another stone in the foundation
of the peach-industry in the South. After Georgia became a factor
in the culture of this fruit in America in the nineties, the State was followed
in lesser degree, by South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and
Texas. In most of these southern states the peach-orchard is so near the
cotton-plantation&mdash;often the two are interplanted&mdash;that the owners
rob Peter to pay Paul in the care of the two crops. But this is not always
the case, and at its best the southern peach-orchard is the consummate
flower of modern commercial peach-growing.</p>

<p>The peach-industry in Connecticut is a recent development, as in the
South. As late as 1880 the crop was negligible in the State; in 1889,
37,295 bushels were grown; 61,775 in 1899; and 417,918 bushels in 1909.
This, considering the smallness of the State and the very uneven surface
of much of it, is a rather remarkable development. Winter-killing, which
takes place about one winter out of four, is the chief drawback but the high
prices received from nearby markets make the peach, despite the occasional
off-year, a profitable crop. Connecticut peaches are characterized by large
size, bright color and good quality. From Connecticut the industry has
spread into Massachusetts where all conditions are essentially the same.</p>

<p>Peach-growing in New York has never been spectacular. Along the
lower Hudson before the Civil War and again a decade after it there was a
thriving peach-industry such as there was in New Jersey and Delaware.
A peach-industry is first of all dependent on quick transportation&mdash;the
fruit must move. This meant in early days that there must be nearby
markets and water transportation&mdash;western New York had the latter
but not the former. Peaches, however, were early grown, in fact, as we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
have seen, were cultivated by the Indians, in the lake regions of western
New York. In 1828 the Domestic Horticultural Society, the third such
organization in America, was organized in Geneva, having for its field ten
counties in western New York.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> The Monroe County Horticultural
Society was organized in 1830,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> and in 1831 the <i>Genesee Farmer and
Gardener's Journal</i> came into existence. These institutions bore fruit,
more literally bore orchards, and a taste for horticulture, which, together
with the nurseries that by this time were being established in the salubrious
climate and excellent soil of western New York, gave a perfection in fruit-growing
long unrivalled in America and now equalled only in California.</p>

<p>Of the history of commercial peach-growing in western New York,
it can only be said that there has been such an industry since 1800. The
product of the orchards of the first quarter-century went, for most part,
to the brandy-still, for the second quarter it was used at home and for
local markets and from then on, since 1850, or a little before, the region
has been well to the front in the peach-markets of eastern United States.
Changes in the commerce of the continent have made great changes in the
peach-industry in New York. In 1825 the opening of the Erie Canal made
western New York the granary of eastern United States&mdash;wheat was
more profitable than peaches. Twenty-five years later millions of bushels
of wheat from the plains, carried through the Great Lakes and the Erie
Canal to the sea, began to drive wheat out of western New York and make
the peach more profitable. This is a fine illustration of the fact that
transportation is often as important a factor as soil or climate in the profitable
production of a crop. Until figures were taken by census enumerators,
the history of the peach-industry could be written only by giving innumerable
items taken at random from newspapers of the times. The present
status of peach-growing in this region is to be discussed in a future chapter.</p>

<p>Another large commercial peach-region is to be found along the shore
of Lake Erie in Ohio. The peach has been cultivated very generally in
Ohio since the first settlements there more than a century ago and the
industry assumed commercial importance in a dozen or more centers as
early, at least, as 1867, when the assessors' returns showed a total crop for
the State of 1,402,849 bushels.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> But what is now known as the peach-belt
along the shores of Lake Erie is largely a growth of comparatively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
recent times, much of the land now covered with peach-orchards having
been originally planted to vineyards. Possibly the region was at its zenith
in the nineties, the plantings here contributing greatly to putting Ohio in
third place at this time among the states of the Union in the production
of peaches.</p>

<p>Michigan furnishes an interesting chapter in the history of the peach-industry.
The industry was started in what is now the Michigan peach-belt
by an Indian trader who planted a pit in 1775 near St. Joseph. From
this tree sprang seedling orchards, one of which, near Douglas at the mouth
of the Kalamazoo River, numbered 300 trees. There were no budded
trees until 1834. A conjunction of several factors now gave peach-growing
a tremendous impetus in the State. Chicago, growing with leaps and
bounds, demanded peaches; the soil and climate of western Michigan were
found to be ideal for this fruit; between the supply and demand was quick
and cheap transportation by water. Shipments began in 1834 to Chicago
and, as this and other western cities grew, peach-planting in Michigan
progressed as probably never before in any other part of the world. In
the seventies peach-yellows swept like a wave of fire over the southern
portion of what is now the belt, driving the industry northward until at
Traverse City the peach reached its highest northern limit in the eastern
states. With better control of the yellows, peach-orchards were again
planted in the southern parts of the belt and the industry continues to
thrive, though with the ups and downs incident to this fruit wherever
grown.</p>

<p>Another large peach-growing area lies in southern Illinois extending
across the Mississippi into Missouri and Kansas. Westward, in Colorado,
Utah, California, Oregon and Washington, are the world's newest peach-orchards,
all of which have arisen to commercial importance within recent
times. In southern Illinois and Missouri, however, even before the Civil
War, peach-growing had assumed sufficient magnitude to be called an
industry. The present standing of these later peach-areas may best be
compared with that of the older regions by a tabulated report from the
United States Census Reports which is herewith printed. In the fluctuating
figures of this table one sees the exploitation of the peach. What
other tree-crop in the whole world could show more ups and downs in the
brief space of thirty years? No state holds first rank two decades in
succession; in fifteen states in 1910 there were more trees not of bearing
age than there were in bearing; there were more peach-trees in the United
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
States in 1900 than in 1910; the figures most graphically attest the shifting
of peach-regions; decreasing numbers represent misfortunes&mdash;most often
yellows, or San Jose scale, a freeze, or overproduction; increasing numbers
stand for a newly discovered advantage. By these tokens we better realize
the speculative nature of peach-growing.</p>

<h3>NEW TYPES OF PEACHES</h3>

<p>The capacity of species to split into types, using types in a broad
sense, is, we all agree, one of the greatest assets of cultivated plants.
Through diversity of types come adaptabilities to soils and climates and
variety in the crop, to mention but two of the essentials of standard crop-plants.
New types afford the material from which greatest progress comes
in fruit-growing. In common with all fruit-growing, peach-growing has
received impetus from time to time from the introduction of new and
distinct types. In the middle of the Nineteenth Century, three previously
unknown types of peaches, each divisible into horticultural varieties, were
brought to America. All three have had important effects on the peach-industry
in America.</p>

<p><i>North China peaches.</i>&mdash;Not very distinct from the Persian peaches
at the outset, its outliers running into some of the other groups as well,
"North China" is now but little more than a name for a conglomerate
lot of varieties grown everywhere in America except in the sub-tropic parts
of the Gulf States. The North China race includes varieties characterized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
by fruits of large size, great beauty, tender skin and flesh, good quality and
vigorous trees which bear abundantly and regularly. The group has
received careful study at the Delaware Experiment Station, an account
of it by G. Harold Powell having been published in the Thirteenth Annual
Report from that Station in 1901. Powell prefers to call the group Chinese
Cling rather than North China.</p>

<p>The peaches put in the North China group are so nearly akin to those
in the Persian group that it is difficult to place varieties. All agree, however,
in taking the European Shanghai, the American Chinese Cling, as
the type-variety and, though it is probable that travelers or missionaries
brought pits of some of these peaches from northern China a century or
more ago, the known history of the group begins with the variety just
named as the type. It is a pleasure to give Robert Fortune, the indefatigable
collector of Chinese plants for the London Horticultural Society,
credit for introducing these peaches into western countries. In 1844
Fortune collected a fine, large, delicious peach near Shanghai and in the
autumn forwarded pits and a plant in a pot to London. The pits were
sown and the seedlings produced fruit in 1852 and from among these a sort
was selected and called Shanghai.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> Pits from this first collection were
probably sent to France, for the name appears in the early fifties in the
pomological literature of this country.</p>

<p>The first American reference to the Shanghai is found in 1851<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> when
fruits were exhibited at the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in Boston
by R. Choate with the statement "peach from a tree imported from
Shanghai." More definite are the facts of an importation made by Charles
Downing in 1850. Early in that year Downing received potted peach-trees
from the British consul at Shanghai under the names "Chinese Cling"
and "Shanghai," supposed to be two sorts but proving to be identical.
One of these trees was sent to Mr. Henry Lyons, Columbia, South Carolina,
and this bore fruit in 1851.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> From Downing's stock the variety was
quickly and widely distributed and the horticultural magazines of the
time gave the new peaches wide publicity, so that, from this and other
importations which were made from time to time by various persons, these
peaches from northern China were universally grown in the peach-orchards
of America within a quarter of a century of their introduction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p><i>South China peaches.</i>&mdash;Those who have read the descriptions of
Chinese peaches in Chapter 1 (pages 14 to 21) recognize at once the beaked
varieties of South China, especially those growing about Canton. These
peaches, common enough in China and cultivated there for centuries,
reached occidental countries only in the middle of the Nineteenth Century.
They came to America as seeds from Dr. J. T. Devan, Canton, China, to
Mr. John Caldwell, Newburg, New York,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> and were introduced into Europe
probably by M. Montigny, French Consul at Shanghai, who sent seeds
to the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, in 1852.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> In recent years a number of
fresh importations of seeds and plants of these honey-flavored, beaked
peaches have been made by the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>A composite picture of South China peaches shows the following
characters:</p>

<p>Tree of medium size, upright-spreading; branches leaving the trunk
at an angle of about fifty degrees and curving upward; buds quite
prominent; flowers always large and very abundant, pale pink, base of petals
darker pink; leaves small, long, narrow, pointed, finely serrate, conduplicate,
distributed all along the limb, dark green, in fall slightly tinged with red.
Fruit small, oval, yellow or white blushed with red, slightly flattened;
skin adhering to the flesh; suture very deep in basin, but does not extend
more than one-third the way down; apex long and recurved; flesh white
or yellow; flavor a peculiar honey-sweet; stone free or cling, long-pointed,
generally curved.</p>

<p>As yet these honey-flavored peaches are grown commercially only in
the Gulf States, the notion prevailing that they cannot be grown in the
North. Quite to the contrary they do exceedingly well as far north as
Geneva, though undesirable because of smallness of fruit and lateness in
ripening. Of the score of the descendants of the original Honey, several
are in bearing on the Station grounds, Climax, Imperial, Pallas and Triana
being illustrated in <i>The Peaches of New York</i>. All but two or three of the
varieties that are put in this group originated in Florida and most of them
come from the grounds of G. L. Taber, Glen Saint Mary, of that
State. An excellent bulletin, No. 73, from the Florida Agricultural Experiment
Station, published in 1904, by F. C. Reimer, gives a full account of
these peaches.</p>

<p>Is the beaked character permanent? That regions in time give rise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
to racial strains must have occurred to all who have read the preceding
pages. The peach acquires distinct varietal characters in every great
geographical region in which it is grown. Possibly in no other character
is the change greater than in the long, pointed, erect or recurved apex in
common parlance called the beak. As a rule, the farther south the more
pronounced is the beak and the more oblong is the fruit. In this respect,
southern peaches, taking them as a whole, are as markedly different from
New York peaches as are the long, crowned, angular-topped apples of the
Pacific Northwest from the rotund fruits of the Atlantic Northeast. The
four sorts of honey-flavored peaches described and illustrated in <i>The
Peaches of New York</i>, named in the foregoing paragraph, illustrate this
well, none of them being nearly so abruptly conical as specimens coming
to us from the South. Peaches in China, evidently, show the same modification,
for those discussed in the previous group are as markedly rotund
as those in this group are conic and beaked. It is a fair inference, then,
that the beaked character of the peach, counting time in generations of the
tree, is permanent only in southern climates.</p>

<p><i>Peento peaches.</i>&mdash;Another group of these Chinese peaches, not very
different from the South China varieties we have just given an account
of, is composed of the score or more sorts showing relationship to the
variety, Peento. These may be rather indefinitely described as follows:</p>

<p>Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading; branches willow-like, branching
at an angle of about forty degrees; flowers large, pink, opening early,
often at a low temperature and very irregularly; leaves narrow, long,
finely serrated, with reniform glands; inclined to be evergreen; fruit sub-globose
except in Peento which is flattened endwise; skin white and mottled
with carmine, parting readily from the flesh; flesh white or yellow; flavor
sweet, with a peculiar almond taste; stone occasionally flattened endwise,
either free or cling. This race is adapted to sub-tropical parts of the Gulf
States where it ripens from May 1st to June 1st.</p>

<p>The Peento, which gives name to this group, is without doubt a
descendant of the flat peaches of China, common enough as we have seen.
The first tree, however, came from Java to England where it was first
grown by John Braddick under the name Java peach.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> William Prince,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
Flushing, Long Island, imported the variety to America some time
previous to 1828 and grew it to the number of twenty trees. The peaches
from Prince's importation seem to have been lost and the variety did not
appear again in America until 1869 when P. J. Berckmans,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> Augusta,
Georgia, brought seed from China, from one of which came the Peento.
Peento peaches in America are peculiar to Florida, where all of the score
or more varieties but the Peento have originated. This group of peaches
has been well described by H. Harold Hume in Bulletin 62 of the Florida
Experiment Station from which the description given above is an
adaptation.</p>

<h3>PEACH-PRODUCTS</h3>

<p>The magnitude of the peach-industry in the United States is better
appreciated if figures showing values are given. The value of peaches
and nectarines in 1909, for the United States, was $28,781,078, an amount
surpassed by only one other fruit, the apple. The highest value for a
geographical division is reported for the East North-Central States, the
amount being $5,173,000, followed by the South Atlantic States with
$4,888,000 and the Pacific States with $4,887,000. Of individual states,
California with her enormous area, over most of which the peach thrives,
ranks first, the value of the crop in 1909 reaching $4,574,000; the next
most important State is Georgia, $2,183,000; the third, New York,
$2,014,000; these followed in order of value by Michigan, Arkansas, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee and
North Carolina, each with a crop of more than $1,000,000 in value.</p>

<p>The peach has greater commercial value in the United States than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
all other stone-fruits combined, the value of the crop in 1909, as we have
seen, amounting to $28,781,078 while the value of the plum was $10,299,495;
of the cherry, $7,231,160; of the apricot, $2,884,119; of the almond, $712,000.
The consumption of peaches is increasing year by year. Until recently
the peach has been considered a fruit of luxury, but large plantations,
good care, quick and safe transportation and wide distribution now provide
peaches for all who can afford to eat fruit.</p>

<p>The profits of peach-growing are occasionally so enormous that the
publication of the figures is usually followed by excessive planting, with
consequent over-production and low prices, followed, in turn, by scarcity
and high prices. So, too, the peach is more at the mercy of the seasons
than any other standard tree-fruit and winter freezes and spring frosts
ruin crops in some part of the country every year and often such disasters
are widespread. These ups and downs, however, instead of decreasing,
seem to stimulate the peach-trade, probably, on the part of the grower,
because gambling is a universal vice; on the part of the consumer, because
he better appreciates peaches when the blessing is occasionally withdrawn.</p>

<p>The chosen use for any choice fruit is to eat it as it comes from the
tree or as prepared fresh fruit for dessert. So the peach is chiefly used the
world over. Refreshing and delectable as any other fruit, it has another
quality, appreciated by those who sell as well as by those who consume&mdash;it
does not cloy the appetite. The insatiable longing of the great lexicographer,
Johnson, for peaches is common to all lovers of this fruit.
Boswell, Johnson's biographer, gives this gustatory reminiscence of his
famous patron: "He would eat seven or eight large peaches of a morning
before breakfast began, and treated them with proportionate attention
after dinner again, yet I have heard him protest that he never had quite
as much as he wished, except once, in his life." In America the greater
part of the crop is, no doubt, eaten out of hand but peach-pie and peaches
and cream, and peach-butter are national dishes, while marmalades,
jellies, pickles, preserves and sauces are as common to this fruit as to any
other. Besides the innumerable cooked products, several refreshing domestic
drinks are made from the juice of peaches, as shrub and peach-wine, or
it may be frozen into sherbet or ice cream. Waste peaches are used with
more or less success as stock for vinegar. Peaches are canned and evaporated
in the United States on an enormous scale, nearly one-half the
crop being so utilized.</p>

<p><i>Canned peaches.</i>&mdash;Canning is conservation <i>in excelsis</i>. It is modern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
compliance to the command, "Gather up the fragments that remain,
that nothing be lost." Without this method of preserving crops the commercial
culture of fruits and vegetables as carried on nowadays would be
ruined and no fruit would suffer as would the peach, since it leads all others
in quantity and value of the canned pack. The value of canned peaches
in the United States in 1909 was $3,753,698 or nearly one-seventh the
total value of the crop and one may roughly estimate the fruit canned at
home to be half as much as that canned in the factories. The product was
put up in states, named in order of value of the pack as follows: California,
$3,013,203; Michigan, $175,386; Maryland, $158,839; Georgia, $156,282;
New York, $141,142. These canned peaches go to every part of the world
to which they can be cheaply carried and are fit for consumption any
time within two or three years after being put up. The canning factory
has revolutionized the peach-industry in the United States by giving its
products access to the world-market.</p>

<p>Commercial canning is a specialist's business into which we cannot
go. The processes, essentially, are the same as those used in domestic
canning and consist in destroying all bacteria by heat and then hermetically
sealing the product in cans. In canning factories the work is nearly all
done by machinery, including peeling, pitting and cutting the fruit, soldering
the cans and putting on labels. To purchase proper machinery, hire
labor and manage both to secure uniformity and cheapness in the product
requires large capital and keen business ability. Peaches are easy to
handle in factories and the work can be done so cheaply and the product
is so acceptable that the factory-canned fruit is rapidly taking the place
of that which a quarter of a century ago was almost wholly put up in the
kitchen. The canning industry originated, has been perfected and is now
chiefly carried on in the United States and Canada, though rapidly being
introduced elsewhere. The aid afforded the peach-grower in this country
by the canneries has been a great stimulus and makes the possibilities of
profitable production of this fruit in the future certain.</p>

<p>Orchard-canning on a small scale seldom proves feasible, succeeding
best, if at all, in a home industry to provide a special product for a fancy
or private trade. Occasionally, associations can command capital enough
to compete with the large business enterprises but as a rule the peach-grower's
interests are served best by the production of acceptable fruit
for those who are engaged in the canning industry.</p>

<p>In the East, New York for example, all surplus peaches of standard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
varieties go to the cannery, though certain sorts have preference, but on
the Pacific Coast where peaches are grown for canning, the trade demands
a special type. The choice of varieties differs in different localities so that
a prescription of sorts to grow for the canning trade cannot be made.
Canners accept only yellow-fleshed peaches and usually prefer clingstones
since these stand up better in the can. This preference is well shown in
figures from California, where in 1913 only 583,800 cases, 24 cans to the
case, of freestones were canned as against 1,630,255 cases of clingstones.
Fashion now demands varieties red at the pit. Most cans in the great
pack coming from California are labeled "Lemon Cling," but this is really
now but a trade name, the old Lemon Cling, the pioneer sort in the canning
trade, being little grown, a dozen or more similar but improved peaches
having taken its place. The nectarine is canned in California but is not
yet popular with consumers despite the fact that the product is most
appetizing and very pleasing in appearance. Its smooth skin makes it
one of the easiest of all fruits to can.</p>

<p><i>Evaporated peaches.</i>&mdash;In regions distant from the markets evaporation
is an even richer resource of the peach-grower than canning. Thus,
in California in 1909, the value of the peaches canned was $3,013,203 while
the dried product was valued at $2,333,137. The figures are greater for
canned peaches, but be it remembered that the canners' profits and the cost
of the cans must be deducted, whereas evaporated peaches are almost
wholly a home product, the grower receiving all of the proceeds. The
dried product is pure peach, almost devoid of water. Peaches may be
cured as dry as a bone and as hard as wood so that the product will keep
indefinitely in the temperate zone, and in this super-dried state is shipped
to the tropics. The apple is evaporated in large quantities but is a
by-product while the cured peach is usually a primary product&mdash;a difference
worth noting, for, with the apple, the cream of the crop goes to the
fresh fruit-market while the cured peach is of the same grade as the dessert
and canned fruit.</p>

<p>The dried-peach industry thrives only in regions, as California, where
the summers are sunny and rainless. The product is shipped so cheaply
that peach-growers in cloudy and humid climates, as in New York, cannot
use artificial heat in evaporators and compete with the cured peaches from
the Pacific Slope. In times past when communities were more dependent
on local resources, the farmer living almost wholly off of his farm, peaches
were cured in humid America though the product, in appearance at least,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
was much inferior to that from regions having favorable conditions for
the evaporation of fruit. New York can hardly hope to compete with
California in curing peaches but two factors make it barely possible that
this State might make a minor industry out of curing peaches. The factors
are the enormous production of peaches in the State, over-production being
frequent, and the existence of a great number of apple-evaporators which
might be utilized in curing the earlier ripening peaches. It seems worth
while, therefore, to go rather fully into the details of curing peaches as
practiced in California with the hope that their methods may be modified
for use in New York evaporators. The subjoined footnote gives the
best account we are able to find of the dried-fruit industry in California
and of curing peaches in particular.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>The most obvious change which takes place in curing peaches is the
loss of water but several other important changes occur which even more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
materially alter the flavor of the product. According to C. F. Langworthy<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>,
Chief of the Office of Home Economics, United States Department
of Agriculture, the carbohydrates which make up the largest part of the
solid matter of fruits undergo greatest changes. The crude fibre, too, is
reduced in amount or softened. Much of the starch is changed into some
form of sugar and the less soluble sugar may be reduced to a more soluble
form. Some of the volatile oils and other ethereal bodies, so important in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
giving flavor to fruits, pass off or are modified by the curing processes.
These changes insure longer keeping in the product, give it greater food
value than fresh fruit, pound for pound, leaving it quite as digestible, but
not as refreshing and palatable.</p>

<p>Peach-leather was a common dried peach-product in the old domestic
epoch before the coming of railroads, steamboats and the establishment
of canning and drying industries. Though not now common, peach-leather
is still made in many communities in the East, more particularly
in the southeastern states. The peaches are peeled, pitted and then
mashed into a thin layer which is dried in the sun or an oven, the resulting
product taking on the appearance of leather. Peach-leather is said to keep
indefinitely, this being its chief merit.</p>

<p>Peach-brandy is still a commercial product of considerable importance
though the amount made nowadays, as compared with that made a hundred
years ago before prohibition began to be preached, is but a drop in the
bucket when the number of bushels raised is considered. According to
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> the quantity of peach-brandy made
in 1908, the last year reported, was 13,649.5 gallons, most of which came
from California. Peach-brandy is made by converting the sugar of the
fruit into alcohol and then distilling. The finished liquor contains about
50 per ct. alcohol. In European countries, peach-kernels are much used
in flavoring a liquor called Eau de Noyau.</p>

<p>According to Bulletin 133, Bureau of Plant Industry, United States
Department of Agriculture, valuable fixed and volatile oils can be produced
from the kernel of the peach. Peach-stones are now burned as fuel by
most canneries, excepting small quantities sold to nurseries for propagation.
The possibility of producing oils from the kernels seems well worth looking
into, since there is now an enormous waste of this part of the fruit by
canneries. Oils extracted from peach-kernels may be used for the same
commercial purposes as the almond oils; namely, in medicine, for soaps,
cosmetics, perfumes and confections. The processes of extraction and
distillation are not complex and establishments equipped with steam
would have little difficulty in extracting these oils. It is said, too, that the
press-cake from which the oils have been extracted makes valuable stock-foods
or fertilizers owing to its high content of nitrogenous matter. It is
estimated that in California alone the quantity of peach-pits obtained as
a by-products of canneries amounts to 10,000 tons in a normal year; that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
these would yield from 600 to 1,200 tons of kernels from which 210 to 420
tons of oil could be extracted. The wholesale price of bitter-almond oil,
or oils purchased under this name, for which peach-oil could be substituted,
is from $3.25 to $4.75 per pound.</p>

<p>Pliny named several medicinal uses for the peach and from his time
down the flesh, kernels, leaves, bark and blossoms have had a place in the
pharmacopoeia of various countries though nowadays little used except in
domestic therapeutics. All of the structures named abound in a bitter
and astringent principle and most of them produce hydrocyanic acid upon
maceration with water. The peach might have value in medicine for
this acid were not the chemical more easily obtained elsewhere. The oils
from the kernels, as we have seen, may be used in medicine. Noting the
medicinal uses to which peach-products have been put by various peoples
in various times we find: The leaves are pounded and boiled in vinegar
for a liniment, an eye-wash, a cure for "scurf," a preventive of bald heads,
and as an insecticide on the heads of children. The blossoms, treated in
various ways, have been used for the same ailments and also as a febrifuge.
The burned pits are also used in making lampblack for paints.</p>

<p>For more than two thousand years stories have been rife of the poisonous
properties of peach-pits and peach-leaves. In a careful perusal of
peach-literature for this period and in several languages we have not found
a single case cited of fatal results to man or beast from eating the leaves or
kernels of peaches. No doubt these stories arise from common knowledge
that parts of the peach, as the kernels and possibly the leaves, contain
prussic acid though in so minute quantities as never to be toxic in any
quantity likely to be eaten by humans or animals. No doubt, too, the
myth that the Persians sent the peach to the Egyptians as a deadly poison
is still perpetuated.</p>

<p>The wood of the peach is fine-grained and takes a beautiful polish and
in Europe is used somewhat in cabinet-work and toy-making. Its numerous
reddish-brown veins make it a most beautiful wood but the trees seldom
attain sufficient size to give the species value as a lumber-product.</p>

<p>The peach is attractive to the eye at all seasons. A tree or an orchard
in bloom is a strikingly beautiful sight while a panorama in a peach-country
in flowering-time is one of the most beautiful scenes in nature. There is a
great difference in the floral beauty of varieties, some sorts having very
inconspicuous flowers while others rank with our finest ornamentals when in
bloom. Several types of <i>Prunus persica</i> are planted for beauty of flower
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
and foliage but the fruit-producing peaches are almost never planted for
landscape effect though their peculiarly sunny expression in leaf and flower,
one of the best types of cheerfulness among trees, should make them useful
either standing alone or in mass for ornamental planting. Those who
have seen the wild wayside peaches of Kentucky or Tennessee in bloom
will always think of the species as an ornamental as well as a fruit-tree.</p>

<h3>PEACH-YELLOWS</h3>

<p>Yellows is a disease or malignant condition, it is not known which,
virulent and contagious whatever it may be, and is the possession primarily
of the region north of the Ohio and Potomac and east of the
Mississippi. At one time or another it has been a cause of decline of
the peach-orchards in every part of the region outlined. Epidemics of
yellows have wholly obliterated thriving peach-industries which in some
cases covered counties. The changes wrought by yellows come so quickly
and are so final, so complete and so widespread in their consequences
that the disease stands alone among the troubles of plants in the extent
of its influence on the crop affected. Under somewhat better control
now, its havoc is less than formerly, but in the past it has outdone all
other accidents combined that have happened to peaches in America,
including frosts, floods, drought, insects, fungi and injuries due to man and
quadrupeds. The mystery of yellows in most of its aspects makes its
known history all the more significant. We lack knowledge of what it is, or
whence it came, nor do we know of any cure; we know only some of the
circumstances and the terrible consequences to the peach. Yellows began
its siege of the peach in the very beginning of commercial peach-growing
in America. Much of the history of the peach is written in the hundred-years-warfare
that has ensued.</p>

<p>Judge Richard Peters of Philadelphia first described and gave name to
peach-yellows. February 11, 1806, he read a paper "On Peach Trees"
before the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture. In this paper
we have the first clear account of yellows:<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>"About fifty years ago, on the farm on which I now reside, my father
had a large peach orchard, which yielded abundantly. Until a general
catastrophe befell it plentiful crops had been for many years produced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
with very little attention. The trees began nearly at once to sicken, and
finally perished. Whether by the wasp then undiscovered, or by some
change in our climate, I know not. For forty years past I have observed
the peach trees in my neighborhood to be short-lived. Farther south,
in the western country, and, it seems, in some parts of New Jersey they
are durable and productive as they had been formerly here. *  *  * The
worm or grub, produced by the wasp depositing its progeny in the soft
bark near the surface of the ground, is the most common destroyer.
*  *  *  When trees become sickly I grub them up. I find that sickly
trees often infect those in vigor near them by some morbid effluvia.
Although I have had trees twenty years old, and knew some of double
that age (owing probably to the induration of the bark rendering it
impervious to the wasp, and the strength acquired when they had survived
early misfortunes), yet in general they do not live in tolerable health after
bearing four or five crops. *  *  * Fifteen or sixteen years ago I lost
one hundred and fifty peach trees in full bearing in the course of two
summers by a disease engendered in the first season. I attribute its origin
to some morbid infection in the air. *  *  * The disorder being generally
prevalent would, among animals, have been called an epidemic.
From perfect verdure the leaves turned yellow in a few days, and the
bodies blackened in spots. Those distant from the point of infection
gradually caught the disease. I procured young trees from a distance in
high health and planted them among the least diseased. In a few weeks
they became sickly, and never recovered. *  *  * After my general defeat
and most complete overthrow, in which the worm had no agency, I recruited
my peaches from distant nurseries, not venturing to take any out of those
in my vicinity. I have since experienced a few instances of this malady,
and have promptly, on the first symptoms appearing, removed the subjects
of it, deeming their cases desperate in themselves and tending to the otherwise
inevitable destruction of others."</p>

<p>In the last few lines of this account, Judge Peters gives the only means
so far discovered to check the spread of the disease&mdash;the prompt destruction
of affected trees&mdash;a striking commentary on the baffling nature of
yellows when we consider what science has done, since Judge Peters wrote,
toward the control of other plant-diseases. In a note of later date, page
23 of the same article, Judge Peters speaks of "the disease I call the
yellows," thus giving name to a trouble that until then had been known as
"decay" or "degeneracy" in the peach.</p>

<p>Later Judge Peters writes:<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> "I am pursuing my old plan of re-instating
my peach trees lost last season (1806 or 1807) by my unconquerable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
foe, the disease I call the yellows. I obtain them from different
nurseries free from this pestiferous affection. The worm or wasp (Ægeria)
I have in complete subjection. I should be perfectly disinterested in proposing
that the society offer a premium for preventing the disease so fatal;
for I shall never gain the reward."</p>

<p>And again:<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> "I still think that the disease so generally fatal (more
so this year than any other in my memory), called the yellows, is atmospherical.
*  *  * Compare this account (of thrifty orchards in
Delaware) with the actual state of the peach in our country, and judge
whether we live in a region favorable to its growth. Mr. Heston's attempt
at cultivating this tree in the Southern manner begins already to fail. His
trees are evidently infected, and many are on the decline. The yellows are
universally prevalent this season throughout the whole country (<i>i. e.</i>,
around Philadelphia)."</p>

<p>We have given but little out of much that Judge Peters wrote on
yellows, his observations and experiences covering nearly a generation.
We have quoted sufficiently from his accounts, however, indubitably to
establish the fact that peach-yellows was rampant about Philadelphia at
least as early as 1800. Smith<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> puts the appearance of yellows in this
region as probably some time prior to 1791. By this time there was a
considerable body of scientific and practical agricultural literature in
America, and we may assume, since no trouble that could possibly be
identified as yellows had been described as existing elsewhere in America,
though the peach-borer is frequently discussed, that the disease at this
period, about 1800, was restricted to the neighborhood of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>We now find the yellows gradually extending into neighboring states&mdash;Delaware,
New Jersey, Maryland and New York. Wm. Coxe of New
Jersey who in 1807 wrote Judge Peters, "I am perfectly ignorant of the
disease to which you give the name yellows," in 1817 knew it only too well
as "a malady which no remedy can cure nor cultivation avert," and devotes
nearly two pages in his <i>Fruit Trees</i> to a discussion of its nature.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> References
to yellows in all of the states named by this time had become general.
Our purpose to show the spread, effects, and early treatment of the disease
is fully served by quoting at length from a single author&mdash;a keen observer,
careful writer and the most notable horticultural and botanical authority
of his time, Wm. Prince, of Flushing, Long Island.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> To Prince, by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
way, we are indebted for the first reference to what is now considered the
most certain symptom of yellows&mdash;premature ripening of fruit. Prince
says:</p>

<p>"This disease, which commenced its ravages in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania about the year 1797, and in New York in 1801, and has
spread through several of the states, is by far more destructive to peach
trees than the worm, and is evidently contagious. This disease is spread
at the time when the trees are in bloom, and is disseminated by the pollen
or farina blowing from the flowers of diseased trees, and impregnating the
flowers of those which are healthy, and which is quickly circulated by the
sap through the branches, foliage, and fruit, causing the fruit, wherever the
infection extends, to ripen prematurely. That this disease is entirely
distinct from the worm, is sufficiently proved by the circumstance, that
peach trees which have been inoculated on plum or almond stocks, though
less affected by the worm, are equally subject to the yellows&mdash;and a
decisive proof of its being contagious is, that a healthy tree, inoculated from
a branch of a diseased one, instead of restoring the graft to vigour and
health, immediately becomes itself infected with the disease. As all efforts
totally to subdue it must require a long course of time, the best method
to pursue towards its eventual eradication, is to stop its progress, and
prevent its farther extension&mdash;to accomplish which, the following means
are recommended, which have been found particularly successful.</p>

<p>As soon as a tree is discovered to possess the characteristics of the
disease, which is generally known by the leaves putting on a sickly yellow
appearance&mdash;but of which the premature ripening of the fruit is a decisive
proof&mdash;it should be marked, so as to be removed the ensuing autumn,
which must be done without fail, for if left again to bloom, it would impart
the disease to many others in its vicinity; care is also necessary, in its
removal, to take out all the roots of the diseased tree, especially if another
is to be planted in the same place, so that the roots of the tree to be planted
may not come in contact with any of those of the one which was diseased.</p>

<p>If your neighbour has trees infected with the yellows in a quarter
contiguous to yours, it will be necessary to prevail on him to remove them,
that yours may not be injured by them. By being thus particular in
speedily removing such trees as may be infected, the disease is prevented
from extending itself to the rest of the orchard, and the residue will consequently
be preserved in perfect health at the trifling loss of a few trees
annually from a large orchard."</p>

<p>The influence of yellows on the peach-industry of the country is shown
by indicating when it appeared in the various states in which peaches are
grown in eastern America and by noting the effects of epidemics of the
disease.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, following the first outbreak, peach-growing all but
disappeared, to reappear again from time to time in new regions or in old
ones following an interval of years after a plague had passed. Periods and
places of epidemics are indicated by such quotation as follow: Wm. G.
Warren, Centre County, reports in 1851: "A majority of the peach
trees have been destroyed by the yellows."<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> In the proceedings of the
American Pomological Society for 1852, a Pennsylvanian reports for the
State: "Peaches have done but ill with us for some years past. The
yellows have swept off thousands of trees."<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> In 1880 in a book on the
peach, Rutter devotes many pages to yellows in Pennsylvania and speaks
of "thousands of trees dead and dying from the disease in Chester and
Delaware counties."<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> The epidemic in the eighties seems to have been
particularly severe, there being at the end of the decade but 1,146,342 bearing
trees in the State which by 1900 had increased to 3,521,930 trees.</p>

<p>Perhaps of all states, in proportion to area planted, New Jersey has
suffered most from yellows. Beginning with the epidemic mentioned by
Coxe in 1817, there have been several disastrous irruptions of the disease
in that State. A particularly destructive epidemic must have raged in the
early forties, for in 1846 W. R. Prince, Flushing, Long Island, says:<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>
"Any one who visits the once splendid peach orchards in various parts of
New Jersey will be struck by the desolate aspect of innumerable plantations
of dead trees, with only here and there a sprig of verdure amid the
mighty mass." Another writer, Colonel Edward Wilkins, says: "Fifty
thousand acres in peach trees, in two counties only, had been destroyed
by the yellows prior to 1850;" and in 1858, he further states that "at that
time nearly the whole of the peach orchards of New Jersey had been
destroyed by yellows."<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> He concludes, in the same article, that "in
New Jersey the peach belongs to the past." We choose as the last of the
many accounts of disaster from yellows in this State two quotations from
Professor P. D. Penhallow written in 1882:<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>"In New Jersey, where the ravages of the disease have been more
seriously felt than elsewhere, the southern counties were formerly the
center of the peach industry for the entire State, but, owing to the prevalence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
of the yellows the peach orchards have been gradually moving northward,
until at the present time the counties of Morris and Hunterdon have
the largest interest involved, and the prospect is that a few more years
will see even these localities deprived of the industry."</p>

<p>"The peach growers of New Jersey consider an orchard worth nothing
after the age of nine years. At that time they root out all the trees as
they would so many corn stumps, and use the land for general crops, planting
a young orchard of seedlings each year to make good the loss."</p>

<p>Still passing northward from the first center of infection, we come to
New York, where, according to Wm. Prince, in a foregoing quotation, the
disease appeared as early as 1801. The son of this writer, W. R. Prince,
in the continuation of the article quoted on page 121, written in 1846, says:
"In this island the malady became exhausted some years since by the
utter destruction of the old orchards, and the determination not to plant
new ones until it became extinct. This proved most fortunate as the
disease has been for years banished from Long Island, and now new orchards
are springing up everywhere, and every garden is becoming readorned
with the finest varieties of the Peach 'redolent with health.'" A. J.
Downing,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> writing in 1849, reports: "Fifteen years ago there was scarcely
a tree in the vicinity of Newburgh that was not more or less diseased with
the yellows. By pursuing the course we have indicated (destruction by
burning), the disease has almost disappeared." Thirty years later, Charles
Downing, writing from Newburgh, states: "We have had the yellows
here at intervals for over sixty years, some times continuing for five or
six years and then several years free from it."</p>

<p>At present, 1916, peaches are freely planted along the Hudson in
the region of which the Downings wrote, and, whether from following the
method of A. J. Downing in burning the trees, or whether we are in one of
the intervals of immunity noted by Charles Downing, peach-yellows,
while present, causes but small losses. One might enlarge at length on
the vagaries of yellows but we can concern ourselves only with the main
facts of its history. We now follow the disease from eastern to western
New York.</p>

<p>Looking through the records of the hundred years of peach-growing
in western New York, we find little to indicate that yellows has ever been
the scourge in this region that it is pictured to have been eastward and
southward or even westward in Michigan. The explanation? Growers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
as a rule, promptly cut out diseased trees. Here there has been less dilly-dallying
and fewer hocus-pocus remedies in treating yellows. Western
New York, more than other regions, has been favored in the century past
by its many eminent horticulturists, several fruit-growers' societies and by
farmers' publications. The result is that there is an enlightened and
energetic body of peach-growers, who, instead of catching and catching
at every will-o-the-wisp notion about yellows, have prevented its spread
by proper orchard-sanitation. Yet the yellows is here and has been since
1824 at least. In that year David Thomas, father of J. J. Thomas, the
pomological writer, planted peaches from Flushing, Long Island, on the
shore of Cayuga Lake, which developed yellows with the resulting loss of
every tree.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> But in 1844 John J. Thomas records: "In Western New
York it is comparatively unknown, and great care should be used by
cultivators that it be not introduced by importations."<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> In New York
the depreciation of real estate caused by yellows has not been nearly so
marked as in other peach-regions because of the greater diversification of
fruit-growing than in other eastern states.</p>

<p>This region not only has not had yellows continuously but has never
had the sudden and violent invasions of the disease that have laid waste
the orchards in other communities of intensive culture of this fruit. The
one exception, possibly, was in the decade running from 1875 to 1885.
A. M. Smith,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> writing in 1878, says that hundreds of bushels of high-colored,
insipid, premature peaches were sold in western New York in 1877,
that one orchard in Niagara County was destroyed by the disease and that
others in the vicinity were badly affected. Charles W. Garfield, a prominent
Michigan horticulturist, reported in 1880 that J. S. Woodward of
Lockport, New York, had a young orchard of peaches, covering thirty
acres, so badly diseased that the trees would have to be taken out before
having produced a crop. Later, 1887,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> Mr. Woodward, speaking for
his neighborhood, says that yellows has "nearly finished the orchards."<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>
To conclude as to the conditions of orchards at the close of this epidemic,
we have from Col. F. D. Curtis<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> the report, in 1887, that yellows had
destroyed whole orchards in the western counties of New York especially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
in Niagara and Ontario. At this writing, 1916, yellows may almost be
said to be a minor difficulty in peach-growing in western New York.</p>

<p>Peach-culture has been comparatively unimportant in Connecticut
and Massachusetts until recent years but the toll taken by yellows has been
proportionately as high as elsewhere in the hundred years of its trespassing.
The history of its ravages is told in such statements as follows: "Yellows
appeared in the vicinity of New Haven in 1820 and destroyed thousands
of trees nearly putting an end to peach growing."<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> "The yellows are
destroying our peach trees."<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> "Peaches are infected with yellows and
are generally things of the past."<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> "Cultivation of the peach is now
abandoned in consequence of that scourge to that fruit known as yellows."<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a>
The foregoing accounts apply to Connecticut but reports are much the
same for Massachusetts, the following being typical: A writer in 1882
declares that yellows about Boston was unknown in 1837 but that "when
it came it swept everything."<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> "Thirty or forty years ago (1842-1852)
peaches were grown in great abundance in this vicinity (northeast Massachusetts)
but for the last twenty years have been almost abandoned."<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>
"In former years (said in 1854) peach trees have rarely suffered from
yellows in this neighborhood (Cambridge) where now many trees are
affected by it."<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>Sweeping westward from New York, yellows appeared in Ohio about
the middle of the Nineteenth Century, for, in 1851, an orchard of 600 trees
at Saint Clairsville was said to have been destroyed by it.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> In the same
year the report came from Richard County: "Our peach trees are somewhat
affected by yellows."<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> In the years that follow, down to the present
time, the presence of yellows, its symptoms, affects and treatment are
discussed in the voluminous records of agriculture in Ohio as a commonplace
part in the culture of the peach though the disease seems not to have
been quite so virulent nor so often epidemic in Ohio as in other prominent
peach-growing states.</p>

<p>Nowhere has the haste and waste of yellows been more apparent than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
in the peach-belt of western Michigan. The history of the disease is well
established in this region, the main facts being: The disease appeared
about Saint Joseph and Benton Harbor, Berrien County, in the late sixties
of the last century. At first spreading slowly, its movement became more
rapid "until by 1877-78 it was destructively prevalent in nearly every
orchard in the county."<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> "The peach industry was literally swept out
of Berrien County in one decade. There can be no doubt of this. From
being the foremost peach county in Michigan, with an acreage more than
equal to that of all other counties combined (6000 acres in 1874), it became
ninth in order, and could boast of only 503 acres."<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> In 1877, T. T. Lyon
declares:<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> "This violent and contagious disease has nearly destroyed the
peach orchards at Saint Joseph." Three years later in the annual report
of the State Pomological Society, Charles W. Garfield, secretary, says "there
are scarcely any peach orchards left at Saint Joseph."<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> The depreciation
of peach-lands at this time, due to yellows, was so great as to threaten the
community with bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Pitiful was the case of the growers in Berrien County; pitiful enough
that of those in Van Buren County, next on the north, but not so bad owing
to the timely and strict enforcement of a "yellows law" early passed by
the State legislature. The disease seems to have become established in
Van Buren County about 1870 but did not become rampant until four or
five years later "when about five per cent of the trees were found diseased
and were taken out."<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> Then came such reports as these: "At least 5,000
trees have been destroyed by this disease the past season in this county
alone."<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> "That dreaded ravage of the peach-grower, yellows, has made
slow but marked progress during the years in this locality."<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> "If the
yellows continues to spread, it will be only a question of years when peach-growing
will cease on the lake shore."<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> These three reports, out of many
such, give the condition of the peach-orchards in western Van Buren.
In the eastern part of the county, especially about Lawton where the peach
is largely grown, the disease was later in appearing, cutting out was more
strictly attended to, and the damage, therefore, was markedly less.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>Allegan County, north of Van Buren, along the lake shore at least,
suffered from yellows rather less, though nearly as badly as the region to
the south. The disease was less and less virulent as the peach-belt extends
northward. At Traverse City, the most northern point in the peach-belt,
yellows has never been epidemic. Passing eastward, the disease
appeared about Grand Rapids, the center of peach-culture in Kent County,
in 1883 and in the decade that followed took from peach-growers the toll
usual in western Michigan. Eastward from Kent County, however, in the
several small and rather isolated cases of peach-growing yellows either has
not appeared or has been an unimportant factor.</p>

<p>The lowest ebb in Michigan orchards from yellows was reached in the
eighties after which new plantings increased remarkably, the number of
bearing trees in 1889 being but 1,919,104 and in 1899, 8,104,415. The
disease still persists in Michigan wherever in former times it became
established. Yellows seems, however, to have lost much of its old time
virulency; or, perhaps, the fact that peach-growers are more prompt and
thorough in destroying diseased trees accounts for the decrease of the
disease. Then, too, the Michigan peach-belt has had the bitter experience
in the last decade or two, of several winter freezes which have wiped
out whole orchards, discouraged many planters, and, together with the
keen competition of new peach-regions, reduced the size of orchards and
scattered the plantations so that, in the lessened communal intensity,
yellows has less opportunity.</p>

<p>Going back, now, to the place of first infection and passing southward,
we find that yellows, though not more virulent in Delaware than in Michigan,
was much more devastating. Destruction is the only efficient method in
treating yellows. The necessity of this drastic measure has been proclaimed
by every authority from Judge Peters, discover of yellows, down.
The strong arm of the law in many states enforces destruction. In Delaware,
however, growers were more dilatory in destroying yellows-trees
than elsewhere&mdash;in fact for the first half-century made little attempt
so to check the disease. When the scales fell from the eyes of orchard-owners
in this State the industry was already ruined. From hundreds of
accounts, the ups and downs of peach-growing in Delaware as caused
by yellows may be shown by a few brief statements.</p>

<p>The peach-industry began in Delaware about 1830 and there are few
references to peach-yellows until a decade or two after that time, though
Dr. John J. Black says that the disease had been known in the State "since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the war of 1812."<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> The yellows-sweep really began in the northern part
of Delaware in New Castle County, in the early forties, when, according
to John Delano, Isaac Reeves' peach-trees were dying of yellows by the
score "maugre all his care, cultivation and circumspection."<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> In 1846,
James W. Thompson, in a splendid account of the peach-industry in
Delaware, names the borer and yellows as the two devastating enemies
of this fruit and speaks of the latter as a "constitutional, consumptive or
marasmatic disease for which no other remedy is known or to be practiced,
but extirpation and destruction."<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> "By 1855 the yellows had taken
possession of nearly all the orchards, and peach culture in this section was
at an end."<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> Yet in the same county, about Middletown, but a few
miles to the south, the disease though present was not epidemic nor did it
become so until twenty years later.</p>

<p>With the passing of the orchards in northern New Castle, the southern
part of the county became the center of the industry in Delaware. Here,
in the early seventies, there were from 1,000,000 to 1,750,000 trees covering
from 10,000 to 17,500 acres.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> Yellows, according to numerous accounts,
became virulent about 1870, was at its height in 1875, after which the
progress and outcome of the epidemic is essentially the same as in the
northern part of the county&mdash;the yellows-sweep was driving slowly but
surely southward. Thus, in 1880, the center of the industry was in Kent
County, second south of the three counties in Delaware, there being in
1879, according to the census of 1880, nearly 2,000,000 trees covering nearly
20,000 acres in this county. Yellows, present and widespread at an early
date in Kent, was not alarmingly destructive until the summers of 1886
and 1887, when in the northern two-thirds of the county the disease "spread
like wild fire." At this time and as late as 1890, there was little yellows in
southern Kent and northern Sussex, but before the end of the century the
whole State had been swept by yellows. There are no census figures for
peaches until 1890 when the number of bearing trees in Delaware was
4,521,623. The toll taken by yellows, augmented by San Jose scale, is
indicated by the falling off in number of trees in the next decade, at the
end of which there were 2,441,650 trees and after another decade, 1909,
but 1,177,402 trees.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>Beginning late in the last century, however, there was a revival in
peach-planting in Delaware, especially the northern part of the State,
and now a new peach-industry seems well started in which, through
energetic orchard-sanitation and diversified horticulture, yellows, for the
present at least, is held at bay. The palmy days of fabulous prices for
peaches and peach-lands, however, are past in Delaware. Here, as in
other communities ravaged by yellows, the value of lands has sunk to a
half or a quarter of what it would have brought a generation ago in the
height of peach-culture. In some cases property, formerly valuable, has
lost all value&mdash;a peach-farm will not sell at any price. The best peach-lands
are seldom fit for other crops, so that in Delaware, New Jersey and
Michigan the whole community, including railroads and steamboat lines,
suffers to the verge of bankruptcy when yellows exterminates the orchards.</p>

<p>Probably in no other State in the Union is the peach more perfectly
at home than in Maryland, it having held undisputed supremacy among
fruits in that State for over a century and a half. Yellows, though always
menacing, has not been so devastating as in Delaware to the north. Erwin
F. Smith thinks that yellows has been present in the northern counties of
eastern Maryland for many years&mdash;since 1844 or 1845. In his detailed
account of the disease in this State<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> he records but one destructive outbreak
of yellows, this occurring in the summers of 1886, 1887 and 1888 in
the northeastern part of the State where in two counties along the whole
length of the Sassafras River it was destructively present. Smith notes
that yellows, at this time, "is moving southward on the peninsula." Since
Smith's account, 1888, reports from Maryland show that, while the disease
is still present and is now in practically all parts of the State, either it is
not now so virulent or is kept in check by extirpating diseased trees. Still,
however, the great decrease in the number of peach-trees in Maryland in
the last twenty years is largely due to yellows, there being 6,113,287 bearing
trees in 1889, but 4,017,854 in 1899, and only 1,497,724 in 1909.</p>

<p>In the South, west of the Mississippi, and on the Pacific Coast, yellows
does not exist or if so is not epidemic.</p>

<p>Would that it could be recorded, as we conclude this brief account of
yellows and its plague-spots in America, that in the hundred years of conflict
some headway had been made in ascertaining from whence the disease
came, what its cause and what the cure. Would, too, that we could believe
that the final holocaust has passed. But we cannot bandage our eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
against the facts. We are as profoundly ignorant of yellows as at the
start. And, while New York at the moment is nearly free from yellows,
everywhere the sinister reminders of ancient epidemics, like skeletons
at a feast that are never out of sight, bid us be on our guard for new
outbreaks.</p>

<h3>PEACH-BREEDING</h3>

<p>But little effort has been made, as the histories of its varieties show,
to breed peaches. All but a very few varieties have come from chance
seedlings. Peaches were grown from seed for centuries and many types
now come true when seeds are planted. After budded trees became the
vogue, until Mendel's great discovery, breeding the peach consisted in
selecting an occasional meritorious tree, multiplying it by budding and, if
it had pronounced merit, turning it over to a nurseryman for the trade.
The art progressed no further because selection was thought to be the
fundamental process in improving plants and breeders preferred to work
in fields where the harvests were more immediate than in tree-fruits. Now
that plant-breeding centers around controlled hybridization, plants propagated
vegetatively should receive quite as much attention as those grown
from seed. Mendel has opened the door to intimate familiarity with some
of the fundamental phenomena of hybridization, and, despite the difficult
and complex literature the professionals are imposing on the art, chiefly
discussions of methods and disputations about principles, the layman
finds Mendelian laws easy to put in practice; and peach-breeding is certain
to go forward in leaps and bounds as the irresistible fascination of the
subject seizes peach-growers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as a foundation for future work, it becomes highly
important to know how the varieties we have came into existence. The
known histories of the many diverse kinds of peaches show that this fruit
has been improved almost wholly through new varieties by chance hybridization&mdash;self-fertilized
seed, selection and mutations are almost negligible
factors. The following are the data: No case is recorded in <i>The Peaches
of New York</i> of a variety known to have come from a self-fertilized seed.
The seed parent is given for 214 varieties; the seed and pollen parents
of 37 varieties. But 4 varieties are reported to have come from bud-mutations.
Of chance seedlings, sorts from seed with neither parent
known, there are 161. The origins of 1765 of the varieties described
in <i>The Peaches of New York</i> are unknown. The total number of peaches
described is 2181.

<small>PEACH-GROWING IN NEW YORK</small></h2>

<p>The history of the peach, whether narrative or natural, shows that
this fruit succeeds commercially only in restricted areas under special soil
and climatic conditions. In the United States, as we have seen, the peach-industry
has sprung up in a dozen or more distinct geographical regions,
three of which are in New York. In discussing peach-growing in New
York we must, first, determine the boundaries of its peach-regions; second,
show the relative importance of the peach-industry in each; and, third,
note the determinants that make favored parts of the State peach-regions.</p>

<p>The three main peach-areas in New York are the Hudson River Valley,
the shore of Lake Ontario and the lands surrounding the Finger Lakes.
The relative importance of these areas is shown by the number of trees in
the regions. More than half of the peach-trees in New York are along
the south shore of Lake Ontario, the total number in bearing for the region
in 1909 being 1,271,514. The two counties of the State leading in number
of trees are in this belt, Niagara with 591,350 and Monroe with 339,375,
while of the other three in the belt there are 166,584 in Wayne, 157,934 in
Orleans and 16,271 in Oswego. The Hudson River Valley district is second
in importance, with a total of 679,662 trees, of which Ulster County,
ranking third in the State, has 313,971, and Orange, with fourth rank, has
212,879, while Dutchess has 63,741, Columbia 51,818, Rockland 21,081 and
Westchester 16,172. The Finger Lakes region, with a much smaller area
of suitable land, has but 322,179 trees, of which Seneca County has
81,440, Ontario 56,495, Schuyler 51,993, Yates 48,350, Tompkins 34,090
and Livingston, a little to the west of this region proper, 19,251.</p>

<p>Long Island, once the seat of a considerable peach-industry, now has
but 34,348 trees, 30,333 in Suffolk County and 4,015 in Nassau. There
is a large area on the shore of Lake Erie suitable for peaches but land here
is mainly planted with grapes; yet Chautauqua County has 32,377 and
Erie 10,987 trees. Beside these main and subsidiary peach-regions there
are many localities in which peaches are grown for local markets or home
use. Peach statistics for the State emphasize strikingly the fact that the
peach is a specialist's crop and that it can be grown only in special environments.
Thus, compare the figures given for peach-growing counties with
these: In two counties in New York there is not a peach-tree; in six counties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
there are less than twenty-five trees each; in twenty-two counties there
are fewer than five hundred trees or less than five acres in any one; of the
sixty-one counties in the State, only twenty-four average more than one
hundred acres planted to peaches and but six have more than a thousand
acres. There are still, however, acres beyond calculation, fecund for
peaches, many lying fallow, upon which peaches can be grown when the
markets warrant.</p>

<p>The acreage for the State and its peach-regions may be determined,
approximately, by dividing the number of trees by 100. In 1909 there were
2,457,187 bearing trees and 2,216,907 trees not of bearing age, a total of
4,674,094 trees covering 46,740 acres in the State. At this writing, 1916,
the acreage is larger. In 1909, along the Ontario Shore there were 12,715
acres planted to bearing peaches; in the Hudson Valley, 6,796; about the
Finger Lakes, 3,221; on Long Island, 343; on the shores of Lake Erie, 433.
These figures for districts cover bearing trees only, but holding the proportion
the same for the districts as for the State, the total acreage for each
district should be doubled for 1909 and, we are sure, much more than
doubled for 1916. The statement that the number of bearing trees has
doubled in the past five years is supported by figures furnished me by
F. S. Welsh,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> Agriculturist of the New York Central Railroad Company.
The New York Central handles at least 95 per centum of the peaches grown
in New York and shipped to the markets; in 1910 this railroad handled
1,341 carloads of peaches, 4,419 carloads in 1915.</p>

<p>New York ranks third among the states of the Union in the production
of peaches, the value of the crop being but a little less than that of Georgia
though only about half as much as that of California. The number of
bearing trees and the yield in bushels of fruit are given in the census report
of 1910 so that the average production per bearing tree in the several peach-belts
of the country may be computed, throwing light on the condition of
the orchards in the different regions. California leads with an average
production of 37.8 quarts per tree; New York follows with 22.6 quarts;
after which comes Michigan with 18.5; Pennsylvania, 13.7; New Jersey,
11.6; Ohio, 10.5; Georgia, 7.7; and Delaware, which must have had an off
year in 1909, but 5 quarts.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is worth while putting on record an opinion as to the status
of peach-growing in the State at present, 1916. The acreage is certainly
the greatest yet planted in the State&mdash;as has been said nearly or quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
double the number of trees bearing in 1909 which the last census gives as
1,014,110. Certainly, too, orchards were never as well cared for as now.
Yet the percentage of unprofitable peach-orchards in the State is high&mdash;at
least fifty per centum&mdash;for which several causes can be named; as, competition
and over-production with consequent low prices, poor distribution,
a series of seasons with much winter-killing, and a succession of cold, wet
springs. These are episodes in the industry hard to overcome. Of the
avoidable causes of the present high percentage of unprofitable orchards
perhaps the most common is the attempt to do too much whereby many
eventually come to bankruptcy. Another reason for the many unprofitable
orchards of the present is that the peach is a favorite fruit for beginners.
Profits in peach-growing are often luring, the peach is an attractive fruit,
it seems easy to grow and the fruit-grower plants, to learn by experience
that peach-growing is not, as so often pictured, a pleasant and profitable
avocation but a most exacting vocation.</p>

<p>Why is the peach so localistic? In particular, what has set the bounds
of the three restricted peach-areas in New York? To some extent, of
course, man-governed agencies have determined where peaches may or
may not be grown in the State. Peaches must move quickly and the
carriers must not dip too deeply in the grower's pockets; therefore markets
must not be too distant and transportation must be cheap and efficient.
Again, peach-growing is a fine art and becomes thus a specialist's business
that must be learned in the peach-orchard; therefore, even if soil and climate
be favorable, the industry lags if it lacks leaders to teach and to set the pace
in orcharding. But, outranking by far the agencies depending on man,
are natural conditions, two of which, climate and soil, predetermined where
peach-industries were to stand in New York.</p>

<h3>CLIMATE</h3>

<p>When are plant and climate truly congenial? Perhaps the best test
is the degree to which the plant spontaneously accommodates itself to all
climatic conditions. Thus, the peach is ideally suited to climates in which
it maintains itself without the aid of man. The peach is perfectly at home,
then, in America only where it runs wild,&mdash;in parts of the South. In
the North, East and the far West, peaches seldom grow spontaneously;
and the cold of winter, the frosts of spring and the drouths of summer,
in these regions, yearly remind us that notwithstanding the generations the
tree has been grown in America it is still a stranger in a foreign country&mdash;an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
exotic from warm and sunlit Mid-Asia. Yet with a little help from man
the peach takes kindly to many climates in which it does not grow spontaneously.
Under what climatic conditions does the peach grow spontaneously?
And under what climatic conditions can the peach be grown
with the aid of man as a commercial success? These questions can be best
answered by discussing the two constituents of climate, temperature and
rainfall, in relation to the peach.</p>

<p>Of the several phases of temperature only extremes in cold are determinants
in peach-growing in New York. The peach stands for all that is
tender and effeminate in a fruit-tree and fares so ill in winter's cold that the
limits of peach-culture are set in all northern states by the winter climate.
The undomesticated peach is at the mercy of the winter wherever the
temperature falls below zero and seldom grows spontaneously where the
mercury drops even to this point. By selecting hardy varieties and following
careful cultural methods, however, peaches may be grown profitably
in climates where it is occasionally as cold as ten degrees below zero. An
isothermal line passing through points in New York where the thermometer
marks -10° in an occasional winter sets the limits of peach-growing in
New York. The red line in the accompanying map shows the territory
in which peach-growing is reasonably safe in New York while the green
line shows the outside limits of the industry as determined by cold.</p>

<p>Even in the favored peach-regions of New York, winter-injury is
a matter of vital importance to the peach-industry and growers seek means
to avoid or check it. The problem is not an insurmountable one, for here
and there are orchards and varieties which suffer little injury though
possibly adjoining others in which trees or buds are wholly or partially
killed. There must be reasons for the injury in the one and not in the
other. These, the New York Agricultural Experiment Station made an
attempt to discover a few years ago in letters addressed to the peach-growers
of the State.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> From the information received, and that gained
by observation, we may lay down the following propositions regarding
hardiness of the peach in New York.</p>

<p>First.&mdash;The soil has much influence on hardiness. The peach must
have a warm, dry soil to secure the hardiness inherent in the species. Only
in such a soil can trees make a strong, firm, well-matured growth, which is
conducive to hardiness. Bottom-heat seems especially necessary to secure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
a growth that will withstand cold and for this reason gravelly and stony
soils, since they hold heat well, make good peach-lands. So, too, a gravelly
subsoil seems to provide the proper root-environment for the peach-tree
and if this be present it matters little, so far as hardiness is concerned,
whether it be overlaid with sand, gravel, loam, a light clay or combinations
of these.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i_134a.jpg">
<img id="i134a" src="images/i_134a.jpg"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption">MAP OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK</p>
</div>

<p>Second.&mdash;The amount of moisture in the soil in the winter affects the
hardiness of the peach. Either extreme of moisture, excessive wetness or
excessive dryness, gives favorable conditions for winter-killing. A wet
soil freezes deeply and trees standing in it are sappy throughout the winter.
Cold, alternating with warm weather, or accompanied with dry winds,
causes excessive evaporation from trees and if the soil be so dry as not to
furnish moisture to replace the water evaporated, winter-injury ensues.
When twigs and buds shrivel in winter, whether from lack of water or lack
of maturity, winter-injury almost invariably follows.</p>

<p>Third.&mdash;Fertilizers may have a helpful or a harmful effect as regards
hardiness of tree. When fertilizers cause a heavy, rank, soft growth, they
undoubtedly make the trees more susceptible to winter-injury. On the
other hand, trees suffer as much or more from cold if underfed than if
overfed. Nothing is more certain than that vigorous growth in early
summer can be made of great service in counteracting cold and that half-starved
trees, or those which have been allowed to bear too heavily, suffer
most from freezing.</p>

<p>Fourth.&mdash;Cover-crops protect trees from cold. Case after case can
be cited of orchards with cover-crops surviving a cold winter when
nearby orchards without the muffler of vegetation, leaves and snow were
killed. Possibly the cover-crop is the most effective treatment of the
peach-orchard to avoid winter-killing, acting as a cover to protect the
roots from cold, causing the trees to ripen their wood quickly and thoroughly
and assisting in regulating the supply of moisture.</p>

<p>Fifth.&mdash;Low-headed trees suffer less in both trunks and branches from
winter-injury than high-headed trees. Buds, however, often survive on
the higher branches and not on the lower ones. The low-headed trees are
less injured probably because the wood loses less moisture by the evaporation
from the effects of winds than do high-headed trees; because the trunk
at least is better protected from the sun and hence suffers less from sunscald,
one of the effects of freezing and thawing; and because, for some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
reason or other, low-headed trees seem to be more vigorous than high-headed
trees.</p>

<p>Sixth.&mdash;Wind-breaks furnish small protection against cold to either
trees or buds. The value of a wind-break depends largely upon the
topography of the land. A wind-break so planted as wholly to check
currents of air is detrimental so far as cold is concerned; so planted as to
deflect the current of air they may become of value in keeping off frosts.
More often than not, however, they seriously check atmospheric drainage
and the damage by frost is greater.</p>

<p>Seventh.&mdash;Young peach-trees suffer more than old trees, probably
because the young trees do not mature their wood as well as the older
ones. There are, however, many exceptions to the statement that young
trees are less hardy to cold than old ones. Old trees are often forced to
produce large quantities of new wood susceptible to winter-killing, while,
on the other hand, the superabundant growth of young trees can be kept
down by orchard-treatment. Old trees possessing low vitality are less
hardy than vigorous, young trees. Thus, trees suffering from the ravages
of borers, leaf-curl or other fungus troubles suffer most from cold. While
young trees are more susceptible to freezing than old ones, yet they are
much more likely to recover, if recovery be possible, and their return to a
normal condition is more rapid.</p>

<p>Eighth.&mdash;What degree of cold will kill peach-trees? Twenty degrees
below zero under the best of conditions kills the peach. Depending upon
the condition in which the trees begin the winter, however, the trees may
be killed by any temperature between zero and -20°. The following
are the conditions unfavorable to withstanding cold, in about the order of
importance: Immaturity of wood; lack of protection of roots by snow or
cover-crop; poor drainage; overbearing in the preceding year; lack of
vitality from ravages of insects, or fungi or from infertility of soil; susceptibility
of variety to cold.</p>

<p>Ninth.&mdash;What degree of cold will kill peach-buds? Much depends
upon the condition of the buds. Fifteen degrees below zero seems to be
the limit that peach-buds can stand even when all conditions are favorable.
The chief factors influencing tenderness of buds are maturity of buds,
variety, and the time at which buds finish their resting period.</p>

<p>Tenth.&mdash;Small-growing varieties with compact heads are hardier than
the free-growing sorts with large heads. The following varieties are named
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
as compact in growth and hence hardier than the average: Chili, Crosby,
Gold Drop, Barnard, Kalamazoo, Triumph, Wager and Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Eleventh.&mdash;In New York the varieties Crosby, Chili, Stevens, Gold
Drop and Elberta are named as most hardy in wood. As most tender in
wood Early Crawford, Late Crawford, Chairs, St. John and Niagara are
named. Crosby, Chili, Triumph, Gold Drop, Stevens and Kalamazoo are
most hardy in bud. Early Crawford, Late Crawford, Chairs, Reeves and
Elberta are most tender in bud.</p>

<p>The average date at which the last killing frost occurs in the spring
also determines the limit in latitude or altitude at which the peach can be
grown. Even in the favored peach-regions of New York, records bring
out the fact that killing frosts must be expected occasionally to destroy
the peach-crop and there are few years indeed in which frost does not take
heavy toll in the State as a whole. In the twenty-five year period beginning
with 1881 and ending with 1905, the peach-crop was destroyed or
seriously injured over a large part of New York in thirteen seasons.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> Little
or nothing is done in New York to protect the peach from frosts. Truth
is, not much can be done. Whitewashing trees delays blooming time and
in some seasons might prevent injury from late frosts but it is too uncertain
and too costly to be worth putting in practice. Wind-breaks as often favor
the frost as the tree. Smudging is too expensive for the extensive system
of peach-orcharding practiced in the East. Failure due to frost may be
expected, then, when the commonly recognized precautions in selecting
frost-proof sites are not recognized.</p>

<p>The limits of peach-culture in New York are also determined by early
fall frosts and by the length of the growing season, though both are less
important than the winter-climate and late frosts in the spring. The
peach-grower must be able to synchronize three of these phases of climate,
spring frosts, fall frosts and length of summer season, with the blooming
and ripening of peaches,&mdash;to do which he must have weather data and the
dates of blooming and ripening of varieties of peaches. The necessary
data as to the average dates of spring and fall frosts and the length of the
growing season can be obtained from the nearest local weather bureau and
in the accompanying table the blooming and ripening seasons of 181
varieties of peaches grown at the New York Agricultural Experiment
Station are given for the years 1910 to 1914. Blooming and ripening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
dates vary in the several peach-regions in the State so that to make use
of the data from this Station consideration must be given to the latitude,
altitude and local environment of the peach-orchard.</p>

<p>The latitude of the Smith Astronomical Observatory, a quarter of a
mile from the Station orchards, is 42° 52' 46.2"; the altitude of the orchards
is from five hundred to five hundred and twenty-five feet above the sea
level. The soil is a loamy but rather cold clay; the orchards lie about a
mile west of Seneca Lake, a body of water forty miles in length and from
one to three and one-half miles in width and more than six hundred feet
deep. The lake has frozen over but a few times since the region was
settled, over a hundred years ago, and has a very beneficial influence on
the adjacent country in lessening the cold of winter and the heat of summer
and in preventing early blooming.</p>

<p>The blooming period is that of full bloom. The data were taken from
trees grown under normal conditions as to pruning, distance apart, and
as to all other factors which might influence the blooming period. There
is a variation of several days between the time of full bloom of the different
varieties of peaches. These differences can be utilized in selecting
sorts to avoid injury from frost.</p>

<p>The peach seldom suffers from hot weather in New York. The fruit
is sometimes injured in the full blaze of the sun but the foliage usually
furnishes ample protection against such injury. On the other hand, for
a finely finished product the peach must have an unclouded sun and ample
air, these conditions giving high color and full flavor.</p>

<p>The peach requires less moisture than most other fruits&mdash;its original
home was on the desert's edge in Asia. In New York the rainfall is usually
quite sufficient in all peach-regions for this crop, the exception being,
possibly, in the southern part of the Central Lakes region, where, in the
lands adapted to the peach, the soil is often thin and drought, season after
season, lays heavily on the land. The peach in New York more often
suffers from too much rain than too little. Cold, wet weather in blooming
time is the fruit-grower's vernal bane in this State and rain not infrequently
prevents a set of peaches even in localities where the spring rainfall
is light. Monthly and seasonal "means" of precipitation, especially
of the month of May, are of considerable importance in determining the
desirability of a locality for peaches.</p>

<p>There are several other phases of climate usually of but local application
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
which sometimes become of vital importance to the peach-grower
and must receive attention in selecting an orchard-site. The direction,
force and frequency of prevailing winds during the blooming and ripening
periods; the liability to hail storms; the amount of cloudiness in the summer
months; the nature and degree of seasonal variations; the degree of
humidity of the atmosphere as related to fungus diseases, especially the
dreaded brown-rot; and the frequency of drouths are all problems to be
solved before planting the peach.</p>

<h3>SOILS FOR PEACHES</h3>

<p>After climate, soil has been the next most potent natural influence
in determining the location of the peach-regions of the State and of individual
orchards in the several regions. The peach, of all fruits, is most
particular as to soils; though, and this seems not generally understood,
the physical condition of the land is quite as important as the kind of
soil. That is, the peach grows well on a rather wide range of soils if the land
be well drained, well aerated and if it hold heat. All subsequent treatment
fails, whatever the soil, if the root-run be impeded by water or lack of
air and if there be not the stimulus of considerable bottom-heat. These
physical conditions modify greatly what is to be said in the next paragraph
in regard to the kind of soil.</p>

<p>In New York the peach thrives best on a light, free-working sandy
or gravelly loam but there are many good peach-orchards in gravelly and
stony clays&mdash;gravel and stone furnishing drainage and aeration and holding
heat. Perhaps, in this State, the light types of soil are too often chosen
on the theory that the peach will grow on any light, sandy soil. Not so,
for the peach will not grow on wind-blown, water-washed sands; on sand
banks, in sand pits, on quicksands, on old sandbars or on pure quartz sands,
though it is to be found planted on all of these. Nor will the peach flourish
on sandy soils at all unless there be a fair admixture of clay and decomposed
vegetable matter and the whole underlain at a depth of not more
than three or four feet with a clay subsoil or stone which must have natural
drainage. The clay subsoil must not come nearer to the surface than ten
or twelve inches while bed rock ought not, at the very least, be nearer than
twenty inches. So qualified, sandy soils are ideal soils for peaches in
New York. Some of the best peach-lands in the State are exceedingly
stony, the stones being no detriment except in making the land difficult
to till.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>The peach is conspicuous among fruits for its ability to nourish itself
where the food supply is meagre&mdash;indeed it is the richest resource of
fruit-growers on soils deficient in the most important elements of plant-food.
This does not mean that peach-soils are cheap soils. Few other
crops thrive on peach-soils, which make them of little value except for this
fruit, but good peach-soils are so scarce that once their adaptabilities are
discovered they are seldom cheap. Peach-soils, as a rule, are but
moderately fertile. When too fertile, especially when rich in nitrogen,
the foliage is dense, the wood-growth is great, the season's wood does not
mature, the set of fruit is small, and the peaches lack size, color and flavor.
But if not rich, never poor. On a good peach-soil the trees should make
a relatively small, compact growth of firm wood which each season ripens
thoroughly; and, barring accidents, they should be annually fruitful of
large, highly-colored, well-flavored, properly-shaped peaches covered with
sparse and short pubescence. The fertilization of peach-soils is to be
considered in a separate topic.</p>

<p>We have been generalizing as to the adaptabilities of peaches to soils.
Peach-growing, through keen competition and the great pleasure that a
finely finished product gives the grower, has become a fine art. Now, in
the refinement of the industry, generalizations as to peach-soils are not
sufficient. Growers must find out what particular varieties grow best in
their particular soil. To be sure, there are cosmopolitan varieties, Elberta
for example, which thrive in a diversity of soils, but, for most part, each
distinct variety or type of varieties has special soil preferences the discovery
of which has often made a man a successful peach-grower. The peculiarities
which adapt a soil to a variety are not analyzable but appear to
peach-growers through intuition or experiment.</p>

<p>Some fruits are made to grow in uncongenial soils by working them on
stocks adapted to the soil. Thus, the peach may be worked on plum-stocks
for heavy, clay soils. Little, however, has been done in forcing
the peach to adapt itself to a soil by consorting varieties and stocks. There
is no doubt, however, but that much may be done when the adaptabilities
of cions to stocks and stocks to soil are better known.</p>

<h3>LOCATIONS AND SITES FOR PEACH-ORCHARDS</h3>

<p>That peach-growing is not capable of equal development in all of the
agricultural regions of the country and State appears in page after page
of the history of this fruit. Climate and soil, as we have tried to show,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
are the great determinants of the large geographical peach-areas but beside
these there are several other factors influencing the formation of peach-growing
communities; as, transportation facilities, markets, labor, ability
to make and dispose of by-products, selling organizations, local climate
and so on. The economic factors just mentioned, as they apply to the
establishment of peach-belts, have received sufficient notice in the history
of the peach-industry in the United States, but these, together with several
natural factors, need a few words in their local application to individual
plantations under the head of locations and sites for peach-orchards&mdash;the
location having to do with the general surroundings and the site with
the particular piece of land to be planted.</p>

<p>The dominant considerations in placing commercial peach-orchards
in the peach-zones in New York seem now to be economic ones. Natural
conditions are so favorable in any of the recognized peach-districts of the
State and obstacles so easily overcome by those who possess common
knowledge of peach-growing, that a crop comes almost as a gift from
nature. Natural advantages are more common than man-made ones;
so that suitable locations are mostly to be sought for in the centers of
peach-growing near a shipping point where the haul is short, the freight
service prompt, regular, efficient, with low freight rates and refrigerator
service, where labor is abundant, and, lastly and very important, where
the markets are so placed that they are not controlled by growers in regions
more advantageously situated.</p>

<p>Advantages offered by local markets now determine the placing of
a good many peach-orchards in New York. A location where there is a
good local market and at the same time ample facilities for shipping to
distant markets is ideal, for it enables the grower to dispose of over-ripe
and second-rate peaches that otherwise go to the dump. The local consumer,
however, usually suffers. Prosperous towns and cities have added
much to the prosperity of nearby peach-districts in this State but generally
these local markets have not received the attention from growers they
deserve. The product sent to the local markets is usually much poorer
than that shipped to a distance. On the other hand, growers maintain that
customers in towns in the peach-belts will not pay for good fruit.</p>

<p>Nowhere are the favorable influences of water more admirably illustrated
than in the peach-orchards of New York, all of the peach-districts
being bounded on one or more sides by bodies of water. The great majority
of the orchards are planted on the shores of one of the two Great Lakes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
slope toward one of the several Finger Lakes, or are near flowing water
in the Hudson. The equalizing effects of bodies of water on temperature&mdash;warmer
winters and cooler summers&mdash;and the effects of the air-currents
from bodies of water are so well known that comment is not necessary.
It is worth while noting, however, the distance to which the benign
influences of water are felt in the New York peach-districts. In the Hudson
Valley the peach can be grown only a-mile or two from the river with
safety from frosts and freezes. With few exceptions, the peach-orchards
about the Central Lakes overlook the water. On the Great Lakes peach-plantations
are found from one to six or eight miles from the water, depending
upon the height of the land, and the amount and direction of the slope.</p>

<p>Usually the peach-plantations are some distance above the lakes or
river, generally from one hundred to three hundred feet. When the altitude
is much higher, immunity from frost and winter freezes ceases,
probably because the atmosphere is rarer and no doubt drier so that heat
radiates from the land rapidly inducing frostiness rather than frostlessness.
As the height increases, too, the sweep of the wind increases. But still,
one is often surprised to find vigorous orchards perched high above the
water, the sport of every wind, so that altitude in peach-growing must be
determined by experiment.</p>

<p>The site, as we choose to consider it, is the situation with especial
regard to the particular plot of ground set aside for the peach-orchard&mdash;altitude,
soil, slope, exposure, local climate and all of the natural factors
which favor peach-growing. All these have been touched upon in their
relation to peach-districts and locations within the districts but we need
to particularize a little more closely to show how some of these factors
affect individual orchards.</p>

<p>The best peach-orchards in New York are invariably higher than the
surrounding country, such orchards having the two great advantages of
soil-drainage and atmospheric drainage. Rolling land seems not to be at
all essential, for many splendid plantations are on flat lands which, however,
in all cases have an elevation on one or more boundaries above the
surrounding country. The more pronounced the elevation, within limits,
the better, though sharp declines of a few feet, ten or fifteen, serve for small
orchards as do gentle slopes of slightly higher elevation. Ideal spots where
the peach never fails are found in bits of tillable land, usually too small
for large commercial ventures, in the rough and steep gulches running
down from the highlands to the lakes, occasionally on the Ontario and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
Erie shores, but more often in the more broken country about the Finger
Lakes. In such cases the rigors of seasons are seldom felt. We do not recall
seeing a single successful peach-orchard in the State shut in on all sides by
higher land&mdash;frosts and freezes would soon play havoc in such a situation.</p>

<p>The exposure of a peach-plantation is, without doubt, a matter of some
importance in choosing a site but the value of particular exposures to avoid
frosts and secure early, late, or highly colored fruits has been greatly over-emphasized
by horticultural writers if New York orchards be taken as
criteria. The theory is most plausible. It runs, in brief: Northward
slopes are best for peaches in frosty regions since on such slopes plants
remain dormant longest thereby often escaping spring frosts. Southward
slopes should be selected for early varieties, the sun and warmth of such
an exposure supposedly hastening the ripening time. Now the facts are,
as we observe them, the peach blossoms with the first burst of spring
warmth whether the slope face north or south; and whether north or south
makes little difference in ripening because the intense heat of our New York
summers submerges slight differences appearing early in the season because
of exposure. About all that shows in the matter of exposure for peach-orchards,
in this State is that the best slopes are toward the water to secure
the effects that dictate the location of orchards near water.</p>

<p>One comes across many peach-orchards in New York in the shelter of
high hills or heavy forests for which the trees usually show gratitude in
vigor and fruitfulness, provided hill or wood does not shade the orchard
too much. Hills and woods provide desirable shelter only when so situated
as to protect against winter winds and summer storms. A most remarkable
example of winter protection by a forest was to be seen a few years
ago on the somewhat noted fruit-farm of Mr. Grant Hitchings near South
Onondaga where peaches are at the limit as regards temperature. Here
was a peach-orchard half of which was terribly injured by winter-killing
and the other half, protected by a forest a quarter-mile away, was wholly
unhurt. Yet windbreaks have seldom proved satisfactory, usually developing
as many or more disadvantages than advantages.</p>

<h3>STOCKS AND THE PROPAGATION OF PEACHES</h3>

<p>The peach-tree, in common with all other fruit-trees, is a consort of
two individuals&mdash;a named variety budded on an unnamed seedling.
So far, the industry has been carried on with little or no regard to the
effects the seedling may have on the variety to which it is budded, yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
there can be no doubt but that the fruiting top is influenced by the stock
upon which it is worked. The present nursery practice is to buy peach-pits,
whatsoever they may be, at the lowest price, sow them in nursery
rows and at the proper time bud to named varieties. Time was, in the
East at least, when the pits came from the run-wild peaches of the southern
states from which grew vigorous, healthy and fairly uniform seedlings but
it is to be feared that most of the pits, the country over, now come from
the canneries and from varieties so diverse in vigor, habit and season that
the resulting seedlings are variable and must make variable the trees grown
upon them. It is greatly to be regretted that the practice of growing peach
stock from southern wild seed has been departed from though even a better
practice might be to grow trees from some vigorous variety or, possibly,
a different species, as <i>Prunus davidiana</i>, which is now largely used in China.</p>

<p><i>Prunus davidiana</i> has, as we have stated in discussing the species,
been tried very widely in the United States and seems to have many
excellent qualities for a stock. The seedlings are vigorous, healthy, hardy,
bud readily and the seeds keep well and sprout very uniformly so that
usually there is a good stand. Perhaps the character that commends it
most highly at present, however, is the hardiness of the species. It is
proving hardy in colder regions than those where the peach is now a commercial
crop, so that, wherever this fruit as now grown is at the mercy of
the winter, <i>Prunus davidiana</i> is a promising substitute for the hit-and-miss
stocks now used. The drawbacks to the use of the Chinese species are that
it does not bear fruits of any value whatsoever so that the crop would
have to be grown for the pits alone and, because of very early blossoming,
the trees bear only in most favored situations as regards spring frosts.</p>

<p>Peach-on-peach is now the rule in eastern America but in Europe, and
to a lesser extent on the Pacific slope, several other species are used. Thus,
the hard-shelled Sweet Almond has long been used in Europe and is found
to make a hardy, strong stock in dry soils in California. The Damson
and St. Julian plums have been used with varying satisfaction in moist
and heavy soils in America; and in Europe, these, with the Muscle and
Pear plums, are common stocks for the peach. Peaches are dwarfed
somewhat by all plum-stocks. The Myrobalan plum, very commonly
used for nearly all cultivated plums, was at one time recommended for the
peach but turned out to be very unsatisfactory and is now practically
never used. The nectarine, Peento and Honey peaches are budded upon
seedling peaches.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>A stock greatly desired in peach-growing is one that will dwarf the
tree sufficiently so that winter-protection for buds and wood is practicable.
The late E. S. Goff of Wisconsin tried for some years to find such a stock.
He reports<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> working several hundred buds on the dwarf Flowering-Almond
without a single union. Better success attended efforts with the peach
on the dwarf Sand Cherry, <i>Prunus besseyii</i>, of the Rocky Mountains.
Of the results, as he dismisses the flowering-almond, he says:</p>

<p>"I next tried a form of the Sand Cherry, grown from pits procured in
western Iowa. This shrub is quite dwarf, attaining a height of only two
or three feet. With this stock I have been more successful. I inserted
a few buds in it in 1893, and while I had less expectation of success than
with the Flowering Almond, I succeeded much better. The Peach grew
vigorously on this stock, and by the second year had attained the height
of about five feet. The past season, although the best growing season we
have had for some years, the Peach-trees on this stock have scarcely
increased in height. They have branched rather thickly, and at present
are well filled with flower-buds, from which I infer that they will probably
not grow larger than they now are. At this height the trees are readily
protected by digging away sufficient earth from the roots, so that the
trunk may be bent down readily, when the whole is covered with earth.
The trees blossomed the past spring and set some fruit, though the fruit
failed to mature."</p>

<p>In the same report, Professor Goff mentions trying <i>Prunus subcordata</i>
and a dwarf form of <i>Prunus maritima</i> as stocks for the peach but with
what success does not appear. Dwarf stocks for peaches offer an invitation
to experiment which it is hoped some one will accept. Such an experiment
requires little more than land, time and material, for it is one of those cases
in which nothing succeeds like success and nothing fails like failure so that
he who runs would be able to read.</p>

<p>Tied up with stocks is another problem. Much is being said about
the necessity of selecting buds from trees having certain characters best
developed&mdash;as vigor or productiveness; large, handsome or well-flavored
fruits; or immunity to some disease. As yet there is no body of facts to
substantiate the claims of those who maintain that fruits can be improved
by bud-selection nor does present knowledge suggest that such a procedure
is a means of fruit-improvement. Quite to the contrary the histories of
varieties of peaches, as they may be read in this text, suggest that, "Like
begets like," while in the light of science a plant propagated by buds is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
essentially complete in its heredity. Yet the whole question is still an open
one and fruit-growers are waiting to know whether putting buds through
the sieve of selection is worth while. The advocates of improving orchards
by bud-selection say little, however, about selecting stocks. There is
nothing more certain than that the stock greatly influences the character
of the tree. The modifications so brought about probably appear and
disappear with the individual&mdash;at least we should be the last in the world
to hold that peaches could be permanently modified by the stocks. The
point is, if buds are selected for the tops, the stocks should be selected
also. To do otherwise is to imitate the ostrich&mdash;head in the sand, body
exposed.</p>

<p>The peach is easy to propagate. Let it be said before going into the
matter, however, that practically all of the trees in the peach-orchards
in New York were grown in nurseries and that it is probably best to let
the propagation of trees continue a business for the specialist. Still, it is
well that the grower know in a general way the operations in the propagation
of the peach-tree. We wish, too, to put on record the nursery
methods used in propagating this fruit at this period in the history of
the peach.</p>

<p>In planting peach-pits, art imitates and quickens nature. In nature
the seeds are self-sown as they ripen, the succulent coat keeping the hard
envelope containing the kernel from becoming stony so that the young
plant bursts forth at the proper season. But in cleaning and drying seeds
for sale and transportation, they become hard and dry and must be subjected
to somewhat special treatment before planting. In mild climates the pits
are soaked or kept moist in sand, earth or other medium until softened
and are then planted in the fall in rows where the trees are to be grown.
In cold climates the stones are subjected to freezing, thereby cracking
them, after which the kernels are sown in the spring. To freeze, the seeds
are placed in strata with moist sand, saw-dust, straw or other material
supplying an abundance of moisture, and exposed to the freezing weather
of winter which usually frees the kernel from its envelope. The kernels
are then sifted from the stones and sand and sowed in rows four feet apart.
Pits which the frost does not open must be cracked by hand, though this
tedious operation is usually omitted by large nurseries.</p>

<p>The seeds are planted in a rich, well-drained soil, preferably a light
loam with good bottom. By late mid-summer in New York the stocks
are ready to bud, though often the operation extends into September.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
The peach is universally budded in America, grafting being most difficult,
though trees can be grown from root-cuttings. The method of budding
is the common T, or shield-bud. The buds "take" in a week or two,
but remain dormant until the next spring when the top of the stock above
the bud is removed to give the cion right of way. At one year from the bud,
two years from the seed, in northern climates, the trees are ready to be
transplanted in the orchard. In the South and on the Pacific Slope, budding
may be done in June, thereby saving a season. These "June buds,"
however, excepting under the most favorable conditions, in the East at
least, are weaklings not nearly so desirable as "summer buds." Occasionally,
more particularly in California, summer-budded stocks are planted
in the fall or the next spring as "dormant buds." In New York, trees older
than one year from the bud are seldom worth planting though occasionally
it is necessary to save stocks until their second season before budding.</p>

<p>In budding, the bud-sticks are cut as needed, after which the leaves
are trimmed leaving about a quarter of an inch of the stem as a handle
to the bud. After trimming, the sticks are wrapped in damp burlap and
are taken to the field&mdash;once dried, they are worthless. The buds at the
end of the bud-stick are discarded, the plump, hard buds near the middle
of the stick being the most vigorous. At the point where the bud is to be
inserted a T-shaped incision is made, the transverse cut being secured by
a rocking motion of the knife and the vertical one by lightly drawing the
knife upward from a point about an inch below the first cut. Before
removing the knife a slight twist of the blade loosens the edges better to
receive the bud.</p>

<p>The bud is cut from below upward with a drawing motion of the
knife. Nearly the entire thickness of the bark is cut at the point of the
bud so that it will not crumple when inserted into the stock. Almost
no wood is taken with the bud but on the other hand the bud must not be
so thin that the soft growing tissue between the bark and wood is injured.
The bud is taken between the thumb and forefinger and lifted free from the
wood. With the leaf-stem as a handle the bud is inserted into the T-shaped
incision and pushed down until its "heel" is flush with the transverse cut.
Waxing is not necessary but the bud must be securely tied.</p>

<p>For this purpose raffia is now almost universally used. It is cut into
lengths of eighteen or twenty inches and moistened to make it soft and
pliable. The strand is first brought firmly across the upper end of the bud
to keep it from working out. Beginning then at the bottom of the slit,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
the raffia is wound smoothly upward covering everything but the "eye"
and is tied in a single square knot. This winding must be tight to hold the
bud immovably in place. In from two to four weeks, depending on the
growth of the stock, the raffia should be cut to prevent its girdling the
tree.</p>

<p>In the nursery trade, peach-trees are graded according to caliper or
according to height&mdash;rarely both since there is a very definite relation
between the two. The common sizes by caliper, or diameter of the trunk,
are five-, seven- or nine-sixteenths of an inch. According to height, the
grades are "three to four foot," "four to five foot," or "five to seven foot."
The medium-sized grade is usually the best since fewer trees die in transplanting,
they are much easier to handle and, more important, provide a
better opportunity for the grower to form the head as he wants it. The
smallest grade often has many stunted trees. A first-class tree is free from
insects and fungi or the effects of either. Other things being equal, a short,
stocky tree is better than a tall, spindling one; one with many branches
better than one with few. The best stamp on a peach-tree, however, is
a well-developed root-system&mdash;many-branched, well-distributed, fibrous,
fresh roots. Practically all peach-trees in New York are dug in the fall
and kept in storage through the winter.</p>

<h3>THE PEACH-ORCHARD AND ITS CARE</h3>

<p>The peach-orchard is the consummation of modern fruit-growing.
It is more than a plantation of peach-trees, for it personifies ideals and
reflects the personality of the owner. A glance at a peach-orchard and
one knows whether the proprietor is lazy or industrious, slovenly or orderly,
procrastinating or prompt. An orchard of dingy, unhappy peach-trees is
an odious sight in the eyes of a good fruit-grower accustomed to nurturing
and fondling his own trees. Tenants seldom succeed in peach-growing.
Here is a case in which Cato, the sturdy old Roman farmer, is surely right:
"The face of the master is good for the land." The peach in our climate
is least able of all fruits to subsist without the aid of man. The best trees
in the best soil, if neglected, have a short, miserable and profitless existence.
These considerations, then, must bring us to the conclusion that growing
peaches differs somewhat from growing other fruits. If not more difficult
it is at least a finer and more delicate affair in which the laborer and craftsman
working by rule give way to men of higher degree who put thought,
intelligence and taste into their work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>New York is very fortunate in having much land in all of its peach-districts
that is easily prepared for planting. Growers are not called upon
to profane the peach by planting it in a field of boulders as in New England
nor amongst stumps as in some southern peach-regions. Growers in the
State long ago learned that it is an up-hill task to grow the peach in land not
thoroughly fitted at the start. Usually the land is prepared a year in
advance by putting in a hoed crop, after which it is plowed deeply in the
fall, pulverized thoroughly in the spring and then planted as promptly
as possible. Fall-planting is not practicable because of severe losses following
from winter-killing.</p>

<p>The peach-orchard is usually laid out in meridians and parallels in
New York at intervals of 18 by 18 or 20 by 20 feet, the former requiring
134 and the latter 108 trees. The topography of the land sometimes gives
preference to the triangular system of setting and rich soils or large growing
varieties indicate greater distance while poor soils and small trees
suggest closer planting. One thing certain, it is poor orcharding to set the
trees too closely. Peaches picked in the pleached alleys of a closely set
orchard are few, small and poor in quality. Pride in appearance and
convenience in working the trees make perfect alignment imperative.
The peach readily self-pollinates so that interplanting varieties is not
practiced, but, rather, for convenience in harvesting, varieties are set in
solid blocks, growers seldom, nowadays, planting more than three or four
sorts. Laying out the land, digging holes, trimming roots, setting trees
are all kindergarten operations in fruit-growing, well understood by any
one qualified to go into peach-growing.</p>

<p>As to varieties, Elberta is now the mainstay of all the peach-districts,
coming in as the mid-season crop. Greensboro, Carman, Champion, and
Belle, all white-fleshed; and St. John, Fitzgerald, Niagara and Early
Crawford, all yellow-fleshed, the two series named in order of ripening,
are standard varieties preceding Elberta in the markets. Standard sorts
following are, Oldmixon Free, the only white-fleshed sort, and Crosby,
Late Crawford, Kalamazoo, Chili, Smock and Salwey, these also named in
order of maturity. A large number of new varieties are on probation in
the State of which Arp, Lola, Edgemont, Rochester, J. H. Hale and Frances
are now most conspicuous. The peach-flora changes rapidly and many of
these favorites of today will be the cast-offs of tomorrow.</p>

<p>In the early life of the orchard, until bearing is well established, an
inter-crop is a valuable asset in New York peach-orchards; on the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
hand, planted in bearing orchards, any other crop than the peach is a heavy
liability. While inter-cropping is not peculiar to New York orchards it
is probably more practiced in this State than in any other. Few, indeed,
are the plantations in this region that do not sustain themselves for the
first three or four years of their existence on the crops grown between the
trees. These are, or should be, hoed crops like potatoes, cabbage, beans
and cannery crops. He is a sloven, indeed, who would crop his peach-orchard
with grass or grain. Along the Hudson, small-fruits are looked
upon as permissible, but are everywhere discountenanced in western
New York.</p>

<p>Occasionally the peach itself is planted as an inter-crop in apple-orchards.
The custom has little to recommend it and is not as common
now as it was a few years ago. The objection to the peach as a catch-crop
in the apple-orchard is that serious complications arise in orchard-operations,
the two fruits often requiring quite different treatment in their
care and, in spraying the apple, the peach is almost certain to be more or
less injured.</p>

<p>In the matter of cultivation, peach-growers are not in the fog that
envelopes and befuddles apple-growers in New York. The peach so luxuriates
under thorough cultivation and, on the other hand, the jaundiced leaves
and hectic flush of the fruit speak so plainly of evil days when the trees
are in sod or unbroken ground that cultivation is universal. Cultivation,
as practiced by the best growers, consists of plowing the land in the spring
and then frequently stirring the soil until late July or early August. The
tools are as diverse as the kinds of soil. Whatever the details, the surface
must be kept level, covered with a dust-mulch and free from weeds. In
soils that are light, therefore hungry and thirsty, cultivation in the best
orchards is almost continuous. To do full duty in such a soil many men
cultivate weekly. Disking is sometimes substituted for plowing but this
is usually poor policy for the plow buries the mummied peaches that drop
in every orchard to scatter countless myriads of spores of brown-rot and so
perpetuate this plague of the peach-grower. Winter retreats so sullenly
in New York that it is sometimes difficult to find time and weather for
early spring plowing so that increasing numbers of peach-growers are
plowing their orchards in the fall.</p>

<p>The cover-crop follows the last cultivation. There is a growing
suspicion in the State that the value of cover-crops in orchards has been
magnified. Comparative tests do not show that trees or small-fruits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
respond to cover-cropping to as great an extent as from theory one might
expect them to do. Thus, in several experiments being conducted by
this Station, apples and grapes give no very appreciable response to the
various cover-crops&mdash;at least pay but doubtfully for the expense of seed
and seeding. While there are no very satisfactory experiments to confirm
the assumption, it would seem, however, that the peach of all fruits would
be most benefitted by cover-crops. It is patent to all who have had
orchard-experience that land is in better tilth when some green crop is
turned under in fall or spring; so, too, all know that a cover-crop sowed
in mid-summer causes the peach to mature its wood and thus go into the
winter in better condition; it is not unreasonable to assume, though it is
impossible to secure reliable experimental data to confirm the belief, that
cover-crops protect the roots of peaches from winter-killing. Leaving
out, then, the doubtful value of the cover-crop in furnishing plant-food
to the peach, at least three sufficient reasons make it a necessary adjunct
of a peach-orchard.</p>

<p>Several cover-crops are now in general use in the peach-orchards of
New York, in order of frequency of use about as follows: Clover, vetch,
oats, barley, cow-horn turnip, rape, rye, buckwheat. Combination cover-crops
are less popular than formerly, cost of seed being the deterrent.
Yet many years of experience at this Station and wide observation in the
State, unsubstantiated, however, by any experimental work, lead to the
conclusion that some combination of a leguminous and a non-leguminous
crop makes the most satisfactory cover-crop for the peach. A half-bushel
of oats or barley plus twenty pounds of winter vetch or twelve pounds
of red clover is possibly the most satisfactory of all cover-crops for this
fruit in New York. Occasionally a change from oats to barley, and clover
to vetch should be made and once in four or five years rape or cow-horn
turnip should be worked into the rotation.</p>

<p>In the matter of fertilizers, the peach-grower early learns humility.
He is no sooner certain that his trees must be fertilized and that he has
at last hit upon the right formula than his check plats or his neighbor's
orchard convince him that he is not getting the worth of his money in
fertilizers. In eastern New York, peach-orchards are very generally
fertilized and rather heavily, the amounts and formulas being nearly as
diverse as the men applying them. In western New York, commercial
fertilizers are comparatively little used in peach-orchards. Experiments
in fertilizing peaches in progress at this Station are inconclusive and there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
is nothing to offer from the work here as to what the peach needs in the
way of plant-food. In the present state of our knowledge, about the best
the peach-grower can do is to assume that, if his trees are vigorous, bearing
well and making a fair amount of growth, they need no additional plant-food.
If they are not in the condition described, look to the drainage,
tillage and health of the trees first and the more expensive and less certain
fertilization afterward. More and more, in western New York at least,
growers are carrying on simple experiments to obtain positive evidence
as to what elements of plant-food their trees need.</p>

<p>The following is an example of such an experiment: (1) Acid phosphate
to give about 50 lbs. of phosphoric acid to the acre; (2) phosphate
as above and muriate of potash to give 100 lbs. of potash to the acre;
(3) phosphate and muriate as above and nitrate of soda and dried blood
to give 50 lbs. of nitrogen per acre; (4) six tons of stable manure is applied
on a fourth plat; (5) a similar plat is left unfertilized for a check.</p>

<p>No fallacy dies harder than that fertilizers will cure yellows. Nitrate
of soda is a great rejuvenator of trees suffering from yellows brought on
by sod or lack of tillage but no fact in peach-orcharding has been more
thoroughly demonstrated than that neither this fertilizer nor any other
will in the least benefit trees suffering from true yellows or from the somewhat
similar trouble, little-peach.</p>

<p>Of all fruit-trees, pruning is most used with the peach in regulating
the development of the tree. In its early years, we may almost say that
the peach "lives by the knife." At all stages of growth the vigorous
use of the knife is indispensable in keeping the peach in proper bounds,
and yet, rather paradoxically, knife and saw must be used sometime or
other in the life of every peach-orchard to stimulate growth or at least
to force out new growths. Indispensable as a certain amount of pruning
is in training the peach, there is no question in the minds of those who
have studied the subject but that it is much more often overdone than
underdone. There are no fixed rules in pruning peaches and to discuss
in full the diverse theories and practices is not within the range of this
exposition. All that can be attempted is briefly to set down what the
present practices are in the State.</p>

<p>In transplanting, the peach suffers severe root-pruning, an operation
that it does not bear well. Thus deprived of its roots, the young tree
must have its top correspondingly diminished. Two practices are in vogue
in New York in this curtailment of the top as the trees go from the nursery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
to the orchard. The most common practice is to cut the young tree back
to a whip and then shorten-in the whip. New branches spring freely from
this bare stub but these do not always come where they are wanted and
often the new wood comes only from the stock. These objections to
pruning to a whip have brought about a modification in which the branches
are cut back to stubs of two or three buds. In a series of experiments
now in progress on the Station grounds it seems certain that the second
method is better than the first.</p>

<p>Two forms of top are open to choice&mdash;the vase-form, or open-centered
tree, and the globe-form, or close-centered tree. In the first the
framework of the tree consists of a short trunk, surmounted by four or
five main branches ascending obliquely. In the second the trunk is continued
above the branches, forming the center of the tree, and, later being
headed in, a globe-like head is formed. In New York the vase-form is
nearly always chosen. In neither case is the task difficult since the peach
springs almost at once into tree-form with a full complement of branches.
Beginning with the second year the main branches are shortened back
from one-third to one-half their growth, if heading back seem necessary,
cutting to upper and inner buds so that the oblique ascending vase-form
is maintained. The pruning of the third season is much the same, except
that some of the interior branches should be removed to open up the
heads to air and sunshine. The third season's pruning is repeated from
year to year, having in mind that the slow-growing, hardy, productive
sorts can be pruned much more severely than the free-growing, tender
kinds. Open forks are a serious menace and are carefully avoided to
lessen the danger of splitting when branches are heavily laden. About
the most common mistake is that of cutting out too much wood, thereby
inducing so heavy a growth in the parts that remain that winter-killing
takes place; at best it makes necessary continued heavy pruning for several
seasons to keep the trees in manageable size and shape.</p>

<p>Heading-in as described in the foregoing paragraphs is necessary
because the peach bears the bulk of its crop high up on its branches, which
are often broken by the weight so that after a bountiful harvest the orchard
looks as if a cyclone had swept through it. As the limbs lengthen, too,
it becomes increasingly difficult to pick the peaches. Even with annual
heading-in the bearing wood eventually gets too far from the ground and
the grower may have to resort to decapitating the trees&mdash;an operation
commonly known by the inapt term "dehorning." When old trees are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
thus to be rejuvenated the limbs are sawed off during the dormant season
to within two feet or thereabouts of the trunk. The tree will then form
a new head which will in a season or two set fruit-buds and bear a crop.
The orchard may thus very often be renewed or even re-renewed, lengthening
its life by several seasons. In thus decapitating trees, however, one
season is always lost, sometimes two, and the writer questions if it is not
better to give the peach a "merry life and a short one" rather than resort
to decapitation to prolong its days. Most growers may well throw dehorning
into the rubbish-heap of the not-worth-while.</p>

<p>Occasionally one sees in the State orchards in which the top is sheared
to a level plane. This shearing follows a fashion, now happily going out,
as it cannot come from any well-thought-out design. It takes but a
moment's study of the sheared tree to see the faults of the method. Strong
shoots are cut back too much, weak ones not enough; superfluous shoots
are not removed but, to the contrary, multiplied as in shearing a hedge.
Heading-in some or all of the shoots may be very necessary but shearing
to a line&mdash;never.</p>

<p>Summer-pruning is not practiced in New York peach-orchards. No
doubt every grower, however, as he goes about among his trees in the
growing season cuts back a branch outstripping its neighbors, removes
an occasional unruly member or one out of place, pinches here and rubs
there, better to train his trees to the ideal he has in mind. Certainly no
harm is done by such summer-pruning when the trees are strong and
vigorous.</p>

<p>This record of pruning practices in New York cannot be closed without
stating that there are growers who do not prune&mdash;not only through
neglect but as a matter of principle. Chiefly, these are men more accustomed
to the other tree-fruits&mdash;most of which make a fair showing without
pruning&mdash;than to the peach. The peach can go a few years unpruned
without becoming an abnormal orchard-specimen but left to itself to the
prime of life without the reinvigorating and form-giving knife a peach-orchard
becomes a woeful spectacle. The limbs crowd, choke and kill
each other, except the strongest or those most fortunately placed, which
push aloft, bearing at their extremities sparse-foliaged, parasol-like canopies
of jaundiced foliage which furnish no protection from the blaze of the
sun to the bare, bark-burned, gum-covered trunk and branches. The
tree-tops are populous with dead and dying twigs and do not furnish
sufficient nutriment for the normal development of fruit or tree. These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
unpruned peach-orchards, come to old age, are the saddest sights of the
country. After the first few crops, when the flush of vigor has passed,
they cannot be profitable and it would seem the sooner the axe lays them
low the better for the owner. Not to prune the peach is consummate
neglect.</p>

<p>Peaches are thinned to improve the fruit that remains, to save the
vigor of the tree, and destroy insect- or disease-infected fruits. Commendable
as these objects are, the practice is all too seldom observed in New
York. The objections are scarcity and high cost of labor. Still the best
growers always thin, doing the work soon after the summer drop which
usually occurs six to eight weeks after the blossoming-time and just as
the pits in the embryonic fruits begin to harden. It requires good judgment
to tell at the time of thinning what will prove superfluity at the harvest.
Vigor of tree, variety, fertility and moisture in the soil, the season, diseases
and insects, all must be considered. The common advice is to thin the
fruits so that they will not be nearer together than from four to six inches
but the skillful growers adjust the size of the crop to the orchard and
seasonal conditions. Thinning really begins, it should be said, in the
winter when the trees are dormant and redundant branches and superfluous
wood on the parts remaining are cut out. By delaying winter-pruning
until danger of winter-killing is passed many growers save labor in
summer-thinning, since, as early as this, fruit-prospects are fore-shadowed.</p>

<p>It is interesting to record that peach-orchards are never top-grafted
in New York though it seems to be a matter of rather frequent practice
in the South and far West. There are plenty of occasions for working
over peach-trees in this State; as, when poor varieties are substituted,
or in changes in fashion in peaches, or on finding a variety poorly adapted
to orchard-conditions. But under any of these unfortunate circumstances
in New York the axe and the grub-hoe make way for a new planting rather
than trust to the skill of the grafter. Old peach-trees can, of course, be
either budded over or grafted over to a new variety but we take it that
a century of experience has demonstrated that changing the whole tree
is better than changing the top.</p>

<h3>HARVESTING, MARKETING AND PROFITS</h3>

<p>The beginning of the Twentieth Century is marked as a period in
which commercial affairs in agriculture are being more highly developed
than ever before. Temporarily, the idea of making two blades of grass
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
grow where one grew before is eclipsed by the idea that success in agriculture
is quite as much dependent on business management as on large
production. We need, then, in <i>The Peaches of New York</i> to set down as
precisely as possible, as a record of the times, the business side of peach-growing.
This we conceive, so far as the fruit-grower is concerned, consists
of matters having to do with growing, picking, grading, packing, cooling
and shipping, while the affairs of the several go-betweens from producer
to consumer belong to merchanting rather than orcharding. Not that the
grower is without interest in the selling of his products&mdash;far from it.
There is no better ballast to keep the fruit-dealer steady than knowledge
of all of his dealings on the part of the fruit-grower.</p>

<p>Among Caucasians green peaches have a bad reputation. Adage,
prose and poetry bear witness that any curtailment of the sun's maturing
function in this fruit is going against nature and makes an altogether
unwholesome product. But in China and Japan the peach is habitually
eaten green and hard. Fungi play such havoc with peaches in Oriental
countries that the fruit must be devoured green or the crop is lost. A
green peach is quite as palatable, nutritious and wholesome as a green
olive. The ripe product of the one is just as superior to the green as is
the other. All this not to point a moral or adorn a tale but to bring
out the fact that the green peach is an edible fruit and that the annual
performance of health inspectors in all large markets in condemning carloads
of green peaches as unfit for food while green olives, apples, pears,
plums, cherries and grapes pass muster, is an unjust discrimination against
the peach. The peach is, of course, best when ripe, soft, melting and
luscious, but so are all other fruits and all should be accorded the same
treatment by consumers and health inspectors.</p>

<p>The peach in western countries is picked for market when it has
attained full size and is passing from the hard state of the green peach to
the softer mature condition. The picker tells by eye and by pressure
of the peach between thumb and finger when a peach is ready for picking.
White-fleshed peaches are green in color when picked but turn to greenish-white
or yellowish-white as maturity proceeds; yellow-fleshed turn from
yellowish-green to lemon or orange-yellow. The full flavor of the ripe
peach develops only when the fruit ripens on the tree but ripe fruit cannot
be shipped and peaches are therefore picked at the stage in advance of
full maturity that will permit them to reach the market at maturity&mdash;one
or two days in New York, six or seven in California. Peach-picking is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
a delicate business for it is equally disastrous to gather the crop before
it is ripe enough or to delay a day or two too long.</p>

<p>Few picking appliances are needed for the peach in New York since
the trees are trained so low most of the fruit can be picked from the ground
or from a short step-ladder. The knack of peach-picking consists of tipping
the fruit sidewise with a light twist which releases it from the branch
without the bruise of a direct pull. The care in handling depends largely
on the temperament of the picker&mdash;a coarse, careless ruffian cannot handle
the tender-fleshed peach with the consideration it deserves. Women are
much employed in picking peaches. Two systems of managing pickers
are in vogue: They are employed by the day in charge of a competent
foreman; or the picker is supplied with tickets or tally cards and is paid
by the basket. The day-system is commonest and most satisfactory.
When peach-picking is in full swing a man can pick 100 half-bushel baskets
in a day of sorts like Elberta in which the fruits ripen at the same time,
but the quantity grows smaller and smaller as the varieties decrease in
size and increase in length of ripening-time. Peaches are usually graded
and packed indoors, being brought under cover in special picking receptacles
into which the fruit is put as it comes from the tree. Packing indoors
is a comparatively modern innovation, the method a decade or two ago
being to pack in the field as is occasionally done now, more especially
for local markets.</p>

<p>Grading peaches is still a matter of local or personal practice in New
York as it is the country over. No state seems yet to have regulated by
law the grading of peaches, as several have done with the apple. The
need is quite as great for such laws for one fruit as for the other, and no
doubt grading peaches in New York will soon be regulated by the strong
arm of the law as is grading apples. The essentials in good grading as
now practiced are fair or large size for the variety, high and characteristic
color, uniformity in size and color, freedom from bruises and insect and
fungus injuries, and full and characteristic flavor for the variety. Peaches
vary much in shape and pubescence depending on soil and climate&mdash;so
much that through variations in these characters the identity of varieties is
sometimes lost&mdash;but grading is not yet sufficiently refined to take note
of either character. Good growers sort into at least three grades,
counting culls.</p>

<p>Not solely as a matter of record but to inspire further progress as
well, we record the fact that New York is behind the times in the package
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
used in sending peaches to market. The antiquated Delaware package,
a truncated cone holding a third- or a half-bushel, is now the most popular
package with growers. This package is a poor carrier, clumsy and easily
tipped over, its sides are so thin that the fruit bruises, it is easily opened
by thieves and it is unattractive. The reason for its popularity among
growers may be guessed when its sole merit is named&mdash;peaches need
less sorting and are easily packed in this Delaware package. The grand
jury of consumers, the country over, has declared for a smaller package
for dessert peaches than the Delaware truncated cone and a larger one
for culinary peaches. Better in every way, and more and more used by
growers in the State are the several sizes of climax baskets. The best
of all peach-packages, the Georgia carrier, is just coming into use in New
York. It is a crate holding six four-quart till-baskets. These till-baskets
are dainty and attractive, fulfilling well the adage "good goods come
in small packages." The Georgia carrier is conceded by all to hold the
palm of merit for long-distance shipments of dessert peaches. The bushel
and half-bushel, round-bottom, farm type, the substantial cover supported
by a stout peg between cover and bottom, are being more and more used
for shipping the home canning supply. In western New York the bushel
basket, if not now, promises soon to be the most popular of all peach-packages.</p>

<p>Our common commercial container, the Delaware basket, is seldom a
packed package. The peaches are turned in, assorted somewhat as to size,
and the top layer faced with the red cheek up. The climax basket requires
more care in packing. The fruit must be arranged in layers and tiers
according to the size of peach and basket. Skill and not a little ingenuity
are displayed in packing the dainty till-baskets for the Georgia carrier,
all depending on the size, uniformity and shape of the peach. The peaches
are placed in rows and tiers which regularly alternate and cover much
as in a box of packed apples. The peach-harvest in New York usually
comes in pleasant weather so that the packing house is generally but a
screen from the blaze of the sun, put up in the orchard. The packages,
both before and after filling, are, of course, kept clean and dry under permanent
cover.</p>

<p>The peach is so handsome and delectable, for that matter so pleasing
to all of the senses, that every fruit-grower takes special pride in a finely-finished
product going to market and more often than with any other
fruit advertises his wares with a label. These show original ownership,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
where grown, often the variety, always the grade and usually advertise
the whole farm and its product. Some growers have their labels registered
in the United States Patent Office.</p>

<p>New York peach-growers profit more and more from cold-storage.
Peaches can be kept for a few weeks in storage at the freezing point or just
above but they soon lose texture and flavor on coming out and cannot compete
with fresh peaches which reach the markets every day from some
source from May until November. Precooling before shipment, now but
coming into practice, is of inestimable value in the heat of the summer.
The fruit is quickly packed and then cooled to 40° F. in a central station or
by forcing cold air through loaded cars, and then goes under refrigeration
to destination. In eastern New York peaches go mostly to New York
City by night-boat but refrigerator service is an absolute necessity for
western New York and has been very generally installed by the railroads
of the region. The precooling station is to be the next step in advance.</p>

<h3>DISTRIBUTION OF THE NEW YORK PEACH-CROP</h3>

<p>In the past the great problems of peach-growers, as of those who
grow other agricultural products, have been cultural in their essential
character. Attention to problems of distribution have had to do with
the opening up of new regions of production&mdash;the expansion of the agricultural
domain; with developing means of transportation&mdash;railroad lines,
steamboat service, canals; and in developing centers of consumption in
the cities and towns which have been springing up everywhere in the
habitable parts of America. Until recent years, little has been done in
studying the commercial disposition of agricultural products. Now, however,
studies are being made everywhere of the distributive systems by
which products get to market and to determine what share of the consumer's
price should go to the producer and what to the distributor.
Everywhere the importance of these economic studies is recognized and
no producer sees more clearly than the New York peach-grower the need
of improvement in handling products to distribute risks, reduce risks,
decrease the numbers in the vast armies of middlemen and in every way
improve defective distribution. But these questions belong to specialists&mdash;economists.
We wish here only to furnish a few fundamental data which
may be of use to all concerned in the distribution of the peach-crop.</p>

<p>In the economic study of the peach-industry in the State it is essential
to know the volume of the product in the State; what proportion of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
total different sections produce; how the crop is distributed in consumption;
and the movement of the peach-crop from competing peach-states.
These data we undertake to furnish for the year 1915, a normal peach-year,
taking the figures from the transportation lines handling peaches in
New York so far as obtainable. The volume of the product for western
New York is shown by figures taken from the New York Central Railroad<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a>
and the Lehigh Valley Railroad. Peaches were shipped from towns as

<p>These figures include plums but the shipment of plums in 1915 was so
insignificant as to be negligible and more than offset by shipments of peaches
not accounted for by the carriers named.</p>

<p>In addition to the above the American Express Company took out of
this territory about 175 cars, mostly in less than car-lot shipments.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>Accurate figures could not be obtained from the Hudson River Valley
and Long Island shipping points as so much of the fruit is shipped by
water, but, basing the yield in 1915 on the census reports of 1909 as to
yields and number of trees as compared with similar data for these years
from western New York, a rough approximation of the number of carloads
in eastern New York is 600. From reports received from the chief
Hudson River navigation lines it would seem that they probably carried
about one hundred carloads.</p>

<p>Practically all of the 600 carloads grown in eastern New York were
consigned to New York City or nearby towns. From the above table
we may assume that about 5000 carloads were produced in the rest of the
State and we are fortunate in having a record as to where 4419 of these
were consigned. The New York Central Railroad distributed the number

<h3>COSTS IN GROWING PEACHES</h3>

<p>Peach-growing is a game of chance from start to finish; advantages
and disadvantages in location are exceedingly changeable; risks to tree
and crop attendant on weather are many; the trees are beset on all sides
by diseases and parasites for two of which in New York, yellows and little-peach,
there is no preventive, antidote nor alleviation; transportation is
perilous, competition keen, and markets fitful. Add variability in investment
and the difficulties in calculating profits in peach-growing are
apparent. On the other hand, keeping accounts in peach-growing is not
as difficult and complicated as in growing other fruits. The peach is not
as long-lived, barring accidents the trees bear more regularly, the crop is
quickly disposed of, orchard-operations among growers are more uniform,
and, no doubt, the very fact that the peach partakes so much of speculation
makes growers a little keener on striking balances at the end of the
season. At any rate there is a great body of material in the reports of the
horticultural societies in New York on costs in peach-growing and from
these data, together with notes taken for several years, we venture to estimate
the present costs per acre of the several items entering into peach-production.
To attempt to go further and calculate profits, with all of the
inconstant factors of yields and markets, would be guessing pure and
simple.</p>

<p>Let us consider the cost of production in a ten-acre orchard. This
unit is now, however, rather too small, for more and more growers are
giving up general farming, finding peach-growing an exacting, full-time
vocation. Often enough it is successfully combined with the growing of
other fruits, but less and less so with the growing of farm-crops. The
first item in cost of production is interest on investment. What value is
to be placed on a New York peach-orchard?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>The value must be calculated from the cost of land and trees and the
labor and the deferred dividends until the orchard comes into profitable
bearing. Selling price is never a safe gauge with the peach, sales usually
being made under conditions more abnormal than in almost any other
phase of farming and showing great variability in every locality. Suppose
we place the value at $400 per acre, a sum sufficiently high to cover, besides
the cost of the orchard, the overhead expenses of houses and barns that
would fall to ten acres of a New York farm. Interest now runs at five
percentum so that the first expense item is $20.00 per acre on investment.
Assessment rates on land so valued would bring taxes up to $1.00 per acre.</p>

<p>The equipment needed to care for a peach-orchard is quite uniform
the State over and the cost of the several items varies scarcely at all, so
that a very close approximation may be made of the total cost. The
items run about as follows: Team and harness at present price, $500;
spraying outfit, $250; wagon, plow, harrow, ladders, crates, pruning tools,
etc., $250; total, $1,000. These figures are below the mark rather than
above but the instances are few in which the equipment itemized would
be used exclusively for a ten-acre peach-orchard; in fact, with this equipment
thirty acres could be cared for. It is not total cost, however, but
depreciation and interest on money with which we are concerned. Setting
these at 20 percentum, we have $20.00 per acre to charge to maintenance
of equipment.</p>

<p>Year in and year out, tillage is the most costly ingredient in the
making of a good peach-orchard. It consists of plowing once a year, fall
or spring, and harrowing on the average at least ten times a season. High
cost of labor brings this item up to $10.00 per acre which includes seeding
the cover-crop but not the cost of seed, for which an additional charge of
$2.50 must be made for a combination crop of red clover and oats or of vetch
and barley.</p>

<p>It would seem easiest of all to ascertain the cost of fertilizers for the
peach but the practices are so diverse and fertilizers are applied so irregularly
by those who use them at all that the data at hand are almost worthless.
Those who plow under cover-crops regularly, spend little for fertilizers;
an occasional dressing of stable manure answers for fertilization
with many; still more, so uncertain of results as to feel they are "buying
a pig in the poke," spend nothing for fertilizers. We shall enter a charge
of $5.00 per acre for fertilizers though this is without question above the
average even if only successful orchards be considered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>A more certain charge is that for pruning. The problems in pruning
are more of the mind than the hand and once the work is laid out it goes
along rapidly. An acre-average of $3.00 is sufficient to cover the expense of
pruning and thinning may be done, year in and year out, at the same cost.</p>

<p>The peach-orchard is customarily sprayed but once in New York,
an application of the lime-sulphur wash being made to prevent leaf-curl
and to destroy San Jose scale. The cost of this single spray cannot be
more than $4.00 per acre but to this must be added a charge for protection
against mice and rabbits, destruction of borers and cutting out trees
infected with yellows or little-peach, averaging, all told, at least $8.00 for
keeping under pests.</p>

<p>The services of a peach-grower are worth more than the time of the
men who do the actual labor. It is but fair, then, that an allowance be
made for superintending the work. Since a competent orchardist can
superintend a farm enterprise of several times the magnitude of a ten-acre
orchard, but part can be allowed for superintendence, $300 for the season
being a fair price, or $30.00 per acre.</p>

<p>Picking, grading, packing and hauling are all operations that cost no
two men the same for any one. Without attempting to segregate these
items an approximation of the total cost of all, based on a considerable amount
of data, is $30.00 per acre. This sum does not include the cost of packages.</p>

<p>This brings us to a summary of the cost sheet in growing the average
acre of peaches:</p>

<p>Pushing this calculation further, the cost per tree runs at $1.32<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, there
being 100 trees to the acre in the average orchard in the State. Peach-growers
expect 150 bushels per acre during the bearing time of the peach,
and dividing 132.50 by 150 we have 88<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cents as the average cost, exclusive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
of the package, per bushel of peaches in New York. In this calculation
it is assumed that the peach comes in profitable bearing at five years after
setting and that the orchard is on the home stretch in the fifteenth lap,
giving ten bearing seasons, at least three of which will be fruitless.</p>

<p>Peach-growers to whom this cost sheet has been submitted say 88 cents
is too high a cost for producing a bushel of peaches but asked to consider
the several items agree that most of them are too low. No doubt few who
figure the cost of production include the item of superintendency which
increases the cost for each bushel 20 cents. So, too, the average yield given
is considered high. Granting that they may be high, all of the figures are
permitted to stand, on the theory that the yield bears a close relationship
to the expense of production&mdash;increased costs stand for increased yields.
In tabulations of this kind much is usually made of the cost of bringing
the orchard in bearing. In this calculation the high charge of investment
goes to cover the cost of the first five years, the period of incubation,
so to speak, and it is certain that this, with the sale of inter-crops, covers
all expenditures for the first five years.</p>

<h3>DISEASES OF THE PEACH</h3>

<p>The peach is attacked by a half-score or more diseases in New York,
two of which, yellows and little-peach, have this fruit quite at their mercy,
there being no preventive, antidote, nor means of alleviation for either.
Two other diseases, brown-rot and leaf-curl, are always present and often
bring disaster, their virulency depending on locality, season, weather and
variety, but both are amenable to treatment and at most destroy only
foliage and fruit, while yellows and little-peach take their toll in trees.
The several other diseases to be discussed are either easily controlled or are
of minor importance.</p>

<p>Yellows is a malignant disease or condition of the peach, very contagious,
usually virulent, of which we know neither cause, origin nor cure.
We know only its unmistakable symptoms, its terrible consequences.
The history of yellows, the circumstances of its coming and its effects have
been given in a foregoing chapter so that we need to discuss now only the
symptoms and means of preventing the direct results of the disease.</p>

<p>In its later stages the symptoms are characteristic enough and cannot
be confounded with those of any other malady or condition of the tree.
The marks of yellows are: (1) Premature ripening of the fruit accompanied
by red blotches over the surface and red streaks running through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
the flesh; (2) premature unfolding of leaf-buds into willowy growths of
tips and the production of shoots upon the trunk or main branches with
growths developing into bunchy tufts of yellow or reddish foliage; (3) total
discoloration of the foliage.</p>

<p>Prematureness in ripening varies from a few days to several weeks;
the earlier it occurs, the smaller the fruit. When diseased fruit ripens near
the normal season the peaches may be full size, showy to voluptuousness
and marked outwardly only by the hectic red of the disease. The taste
indicates the disease&mdash;in insipid, mawkish or bitter specimens which show
the red color and undersize of prematured peaches. During the first season
prematured fruit may show only on particular branches or even on a single
shoot which may not differ in appearance from other parts of the tree.
Prematureness, unaccompanied by other symptoms of yellows, may be
due to borers, drought, neglect, girdling or similar causes.</p>

<p>The second symptom is the opening of winter-buds out of season.
This usually occurs a year later than the appearance of prematured, red-colored
fruits. The buds may push forth shortly after they have formed
in mid-summer while the tree-top is still bearing its fruit and foliage or they
may delay until the next spring, to appear a few days in advance of normal
leafing-time. Very often these buds begin growth in the autumn after
healthy leaves have fallen. Such diseased buds may develop on tips of
branches, especially water-sprouts, but feeble, sickly shoots due to the
disease usually appear in considerable numbers on main limbs and on the
trunk, no doubt under the influence of the yellows on old resting buds
buried deep in the bark of the wood. Sometimes these yellow shoots are
unbranched but oftener they are much branched and frequently but
bunchy tufts of foliage, stems slender, leaves pale green, small, narrow and
standing out stiffly at nearly right angles to the stems.</p>

<p>In the final stage of the disease the trees assume the yellowish leaves
which give name to the trouble, though sometimes the yellow is tinged
with red. Yellows is an unfortunate name since so many other troubles
of the peach cause the foliage to take on the jaundiced appearance of this
disease. The third stage marks the beginning of the end&mdash;sometimes
three years, sometimes five or six, but always death sooner or later, there
being no instance on record of a diseased tree having been cured.</p>

<p>This, in brief, is the usual course of yellows, but it follows no invariable
rule in its development. Yellows is known to be spread as a contagion
by affected buds in nursery stock, by nursery-trees, by orchard-trees, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
may even be communicated by pits from affected trees. That it must be
caused or transmitted in still other ways is apparent to all who have had
experience with the disease. It seems not, however, to linger in the soil,
for trees may be set in the very spots from whence diseased plants have been
removed without danger to the newcomer. "War to the knife and the
knife to the hilt"&mdash;absolute extermination, root and branch, by ax
and fire, is the only known method of subduing yellows.</p>

<p>Little-peach is possibly a variant of peach-yellows or, at least, is very
similar in nature. It seems to have been described first in Michigan in the
early nineties of the last century but had attacked orchards in New York
before that time so that it is now impossible to say where it first appeared.
Be that as it may, the disease is not now the exclusive possession of either
state but in the twenty years of its history has become as widely distributed
as yellows, covering about the same territory, and seems now to be equally
destructive. Outwardly the disease differs from yellows chiefly: (1) In
delayed rather than premature ripening of the under-sized fruits of little-peach;
(2) the leaves usually show more green than in yellows and show a
decided tendency to droop or roll; (3) little-peach, as a rule, appears later
in the season than yellows; (4) the characteristic, sickly, wiry shoots of
yellows are seldom present in little-peach. Little-peach is kept at bay,
as in yellows, by extermination of affected trees.</p>

<p>Rosette, though distinct in most of its symptoms from yellows and
little-peach, is clearly similar in nature, is just as virulent and contagious,
is communicated in the same ways and requires the same treatment. On
trees affected with rosette the fruits shrivel and drop and tufts or rosettes
of leaves develop freely. Rosette is not found in New York nor north
of the Potomac and hence is of but passing interest to peach-growers in
this State.</p>

<p>Brown-rot (<i>Sclerotinia fructigena</i> (Persoon) Schroeter), known also
as fruit-mold and ripe-rot, attacks flowers and shoots of the peach, but is
most conspicuous on the ripe or ripening fruits. Here its presence is
quickly detected by a dark discoloration of the skin which is afterwards
partly or wholly covered with pustule-like aggregations of gray spores.
The decayed fruits fall to the ground or more often hang to the tree,
becoming shriveled mummies, each mummy being a storehouse of fungus
threads and spores from which infestation spreads to the next crop. The
rot spreads with surprising rapidity on the fruits in warm, damp weather
either before the fruit is picked or in baskets while being shipped or stored.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
Preventive remedies have so far met with but indifferent success; probably
the best method of control is to destroy the mummy-like fruits and all
other sources of infection either by picking them from the trees, or much
better by plowing them under deeply. Even so it is impossible to exterminate
all of the countless myriads of brown-rot spores. Spraying with
the self-boiled lime-sulphur mixture three times at intervals of three weeks,
beginning as the calyxes drop, is the appointed preventive but the results
are uncertain, as this is one of the diseases in which it is difficult to touch
the spot in spraying. Varieties of peaches show various degrees of susceptibility
to brown-rot.</p>

<p>Peach leaf-curl (<i>Exoascus deformans</i> (Berk.) Fuckel) is the best-known
and probably the most prevalent fungus disease of the peach in
New York. The disease appears in early spring as the leaves unfold and
continues until warm, dry, summer weather prevails. The name describes
the disease so that all may know it&mdash;the leaves curl, then become puckered,
distorted and much thickened, turn from normal green to yellow, tinged
with red, and finally fall. In severe cases the trees may be defoliated,
though a second covering of leaves almost always comes out. Leaf-curl
is most prevalent and most virulent in cool, moist weather. The disease
is easily controlled by spraying with lime-sulphur, bordeaux mixture or
any other good fungicide applied while the trees are dormant.</p>

<p>In common with other species of Prunus the foliage of peaches is
attacked by several fungi which produce diseased spots on the leaves, the
dead areas usually dropping out leaving holes as if punctured by shot,
giving the names "shot-hole fungus," "leaf-spot" and "leaf-blight."
Two fungi are in the main responsible for these leaf-troubles, <i>Cylindrosporium
padi</i> Karsten and <i>Cercospora circumscissa</i> Saccardo. The ravages
of these fungi are prevented by the use of the self-boiled lime-sulphur
mixture. With these, as with other fungi, cultivation has a salutary
effect as it destroys diseased leaves which harbor the fungi during their
resting period and keeps the trees vigorous enough to resist the fungi.</p>

<p>Peach-scab (<i>Cladosporium carpophilum</i> Thüm.) is a common and
destructive fungus in peach-growing districts on the Atlantic seaboard
and is found rather frequently in New York but seldom does much injury
in the State. It appears in sooty, black spots and blotches on the surface
of the peach, causing atrophy and hardening of the parts affected which,
in severe cases, crack badly. Twigs and leaves may be affected. White-fleshed
sorts suffer most and are ruined for the market even in mild attacks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
Self-boiled lime and sulphur, if it does not wholly prevent infections, at
least alleviates the trouble.</p>

<p>Peach-growers in New York are much plagued by a mildew yet suffer
small loss from it, though the disease greatly injures peach-foliage in some
regions. The delicate, white or grayish powder, giving the name "powdery
mildew," consists of the spores and mycelium of a fungus (<i>Sphærotheca
pannosa</i> (Wallroth) Léveillé) which attacks the leaves of several species
of Prunus causing them to curl and crinkle and sometimes to drop. It
occurs most often when there are sudden changes in temperature. When
treatment is necessary, the self-boiled lime-sulphur mixture is used.</p>

<p>In common with all tree-fruits, the peach is attacked by crown-gall
(<i>Bacterium tumefaciens</i> Smith and Townsend). In New York crown-gall
seldom greatly injures old trees but nursery plants are sometimes
girdled by the galls, seriously injuring them. Badly diseased young plants,
therefore, should not be planted. The galls are tumor-like structures,
usually at the juncture of top and root, which vary from the size of a pea
to that of a large egg, forming at maturity rough, knotty, dark-colored
masses. Neither preventive nor cure is known. Planting diseased trees
is not a safe practice, nor should the peach be set in ground known to have
recently had trees badly infected. The raspberry is a common carrier of
crown-gall and should not be planted as an inter-crop in a peach-orchard.</p>

<p>The peach suffers more or less from an excessive flow of gum. This
gumming is usually a secondary effect of injuries caused by fungi, bacteria,
insects, frost, sunscald, and mechanical agencies. There is a good deal
of difference in the susceptibilities of varieties to this trouble, sorts having
hard wood suffering less than those having soft wood. There is less
gumming, too, on trees in soils favoring the maturity of wood, under conditions
where sun and frost are not injurious, and, obviously, in orchards
where by good care the primary causes of the diseases are kept out.</p>

<h3>INSECTS ATTACKING THE PEACH</h3>

<p>The peach has its full share of troublesome insects, entomologists
listing about forty species, at least half of which are either destructive or
annoying in New York. The peach cannot undergo hardships and once
it is beset by parasites, it does not prosper. No small part of the peach-grower's
time, therefore, is spent in combating the insect-pests of his trees.
The several pestiferous species vary greatly in importance, the peach-borer
probably holding first place in destructiveness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>The peach-borer (<i>Sanninoidea exitiosa</i> Say) is probably the commonest
and is certainly the most ancient enemy of the peach in America. It is
found everywhere east of the Rocky Mountains and, since it is a native, its
natural host being the wild species of Prunus, it has been a parasite on the
peach from the earliest introduction of this fruit. All in all, it is the most
destructive insect-pest of the peach, its presence always endangering the
life of the tree. All peach-growers know the peach-borer. It is a white,
grub-like caterpillar with a yellowish, shield-like head, which lives and
feeds in the trunk of the peach just below the surface of the ground, eating
out irregular chambers and galleries underneath the bark, sometimes
girdling the trees. The pest is easily discovered through the exudation
from the infested part of gum mixed with borings and excreta. The
borers are found at all times in the summer, usually very small in late
summer and autumn but an inch or more in length in early summer. The
borer is a larva of a wasp-like moth which lays its eggs in early summer;
these hatch in from seven to ten days and the minute borers work their
way into the tree. The moth may be deterred somewhat from depositing
her eggs by thorough cultivation, mounding the trees and, according to
some, by the use of obnoxious coverings or poisonous washes on the trunk.
Preventive measures are seldom sufficiently effective, however, and the
borers must be destroyed. This is best done by digging them out with a
knife or wire&mdash;"worming" in the parlance of the peach-grower.</p>

<p>The lesser peach-borer (<i>Sesia pictipes</i> Grote &amp; Robinson) is rather infrequently
found infesting the peach in New York. It usually attacks only
old trees or those showing injury from freezing or other causes. The borer
is much like the common peach-borer, described in the foregoing paragraph,
but is smaller, seldom reaching the length of four-fifths of an inch.
Unlike the true borer, it infests the trunks as well as the crowns of peach-trees,
feeding in much the same way. Fortunately the pest is not common
in the State, for it is rather difficult to control, since not only the crown
but the trunk must be reached in worming for the pest.</p>

<p>The plum-curculio (<i>Conotrachelus nenuphar</i> Herbst) is sometimes a
troublesome pest of the peach. It is a rough, grayish, hump-backed
snout-beetle somewhat less than a quarter of an inch in length, an insect
so familiar to fruit-growers as hardly to need description. The female
beetle pierces the skin of the young peaches and places an egg in the
puncture. About this cavity she gouges out a crescent-shaped trench,
the puncture and trench making the star and crescent of the Ottoman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
Empire, hence the common name, "Little Turk." The egg-laying process
may be repeated in a number of fruits and from each egg a larva hatches
within a week and burrows to the stone, making a wormy fruit. Most of
the infested fruits drop. Poisoning with an arsenate is the chief means
of combating the pest. Rubbish and vegetation offer hiding places and
hibernating quarters for the insects and hence cultivated orchards are
most free from curculio. The thin-skinned nectarines are damaged most
by the insect but peaches are attacked rather freely. Early peaches suffer
much more than late ones from curculio; thus, of standard sorts in New
York, Greensboro and Carman are usually injured more or less while
Salwey and Chili seldom show a puncture. The plum-orchard is usually
the source of supply of curculio and early peaches ought not, therefore,
be set with or near plums.</p>

<p>San Jose scale (<i>Aspidiotus perniciosus</i> Comstock) is as harmful to
peaches as to any other tree-fruit. The insect is now so well known in all
fruit-growing regions as scarcely to need description. It is usually first
recognized by its work, evidence of its presence being dead or dying twigs&mdash;oftentimes
the whole tree is moribund. Examination shows the twigs or
trees to be covered with myriads of minute scales, the size of a small pin-head,
which give the infested bark a scurfy, ashy look. If the bark be
cut or scraped, a reddish discoloration is found. Leaves and fruit as well
as bark are infested, the insidious pest, however, usually first gaining a
foothold on the trunk or a large branch. Reproduction is continuous
throughout the summer in this climate so that the insects multiply by
leaps and bounds. The peach, possibly, succumbs more quickly than any
other fruit, three years sufficing for the destruction of a young orchard
if the pest be brought in on nursery stock. The rougher-barked, older
trees resist longer and suffer less injury. Still, old orchards are irretrievably
ruined in one or two seasons of unrestricted breeding. Peach-growers,
in common with all fruit-growers, find the lime-sulphur solution
applied in the dormant season the most effective spray in combating this
insect. There are several insect-enemies of the scale that are valuable
allies and entomologists say that the insects seem more susceptible to the
climatic condition of the country than formerly but still natural checks
are far from sufficient and the peach-grower should quickly attack with
the spray-nozzle at the first appearance of scale.</p>

<p>Besides the San Jose there are several other scales more or less
abundant in New York orchards, two of which make the peach their favorite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
host. These are the West Indian peach-scale (<i>Aulacaspis pentagona</i>
Targioni) and the Peach-Lecanium (<i>Eulecanium nigrofasciatum</i> Pergande).
Neither, however, is very troublesome as far north as New York and both
are kept well under control by the treatment for the more common San
Jose. The Lecanium is responsible for the discolored, sooty peaches
occasionally found in parts of the State; for, though the discoloration
is caused by a soot-fungus, the fungus lives in the honey-dew of the
scale.</p>

<p>The black peach-aphis (<i>Aphis persicæ-niger</i> E. F. Smith) is sometimes
a serious pest in light peach-soils in New York but is not nearly as troublesome
here as it is in states having a larger proportion of sandy land since
it seems to find life easiest in light, warm soils. The insect is an intensely
black, shining louse with brownish legs. It lives underground more than
above ground, maintaining itself for most part on the tender roots of newly
set or nursery trees, being found only occasionally on shoots and foliage.
An expert eye detects the presence of the lice by the sparse and jaundiced
foliage of young trees which an untrained eye would say were down with
incipient yellows&mdash;indeed countless numbers of young trees have been
sacrificed to the yellow's pyre when they suffered only from lice on the
roots. The pest is easily detected on stock received from nurseries&mdash;the
chief source of infestation&mdash;and the trees may be dipped or fumigated
as for San Jose scale, thus completely exterminating the aphids. Good
culture and a dressing of some fertilizer will help to carry young orchards
through an infestation though treatment to a dose of a pound of ground
tobacco stems worked in the soil about the roots may be necessary.</p>

<p>There is, too, a green plant-louse (<i>Myzus persicae</i> Sulzer) more or less
common on peaches in the State every season. It is very similar in appearance
to the green aphis of the apple and other plants and makes its presence
known by much the same effect on the leaves. It works on the underside
of the leaves along the veins, causing the leaves to pucker, curl and
crinkle much as with leaf-curl. This green louse, however, is seldom
numerous or harmful enough on peaches to require treatment. Should
treatment be required, no doubt nicotine, now the standard remedy
for aphids on foliage, would keep the pest under.</p>

<p>The fruit-tree bark-beetle (<i>Eccoptogaster rugulosus</i> Ratzeburg), known
in New York as the shot-hole borer, is often a serious menace to old or
decrepit peach-trees. The beetle is a small, cylindrical insect an eighth
of an inch long, one-third as wide, the body uniformly black and the surface
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
closely and deeply pitted and punctured, the punctures on the wing-covers
arranged in rows. Injury to the peach by this insect is first indicated by
exudation of gum from trunk and branches and later by numerous small,
round holes as if the tree had been struck by shot. Healthy, vigorous trees
are seldom attacked and if so the larvae do not develop, but a peach-tree
suffering a decline from any cause whatsoever is open to immediate attack
and once the pest gains foothold the plant is doomed. Here, indeed, an
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, for keeping the orchard
constantly in healthy, vigorous condition to avoid accidental introduction,
and prompt removal and destruction of infested trees, both preventive
measures, constitute the only satisfactory treatment.</p>

<p>The peach twig-borer (<i>Anarsia lineatella</i> Zell.) imported from Europe,
has at times been a troublesome pest of the peach in parts of the United
States but causes little injury in New York. Still, it can be found every
year in nearly every peach-district in the State and needs, therefore, to be
guarded against since it may some time appear in sufficient numbers to
become formidable. The adult is a moth the larva of which is about
one-half inch long, pinkish in color. This larva is the borer and in early
spring attacks tender shoots boring down into the pith. It passes from
one succulent shoot to another so that often many wilted shoots may be
examined before the borer is found. Fortunately peach-trees send out
shoots about as rapidly as this pest can destroy them so that in New York,
at least, unless the tree is much weakened in vitality, not much harm is
done. The twig-borer has small chance in a well-kept orchard, but, should
it attain headway, prompt treatment with arsenate of lead will at once
cut short its career.</p>

<p>Occasionally complaints come that the common rose-bug or rose-chafer
(<i>Macrodactylus subspinosus</i> Fabricius) is at work on the peach.
Leaves, flowers and fruits are eaten. The fuzz on the epidermis of the
fruit is a deterrent but once a beetle gets through into the flesh, a dozen
more join in the banquet and the peach is quickly ruined. Now and then
one hears of a crop destroyed by the beetle. Insecticides seldom avail,
for the insects are very resistant to poisons. The insects breed only in
waste places and hence they may be looked for in the orchards of the sloven
or where slovenly kept fields adjoin. Cultivation and sanitation are, then,
the preventives. In New York rose-bugs are abundant only in warm,
sandy soils.

<p>Perhaps the peach most of all desired nowadays by peach-growers
is a very early, yellow-fleshed freestone. For years Admiral Dewey and
Triumph, both seedlings of Alexander, have been grown to fill this place
and both, in the main, fail. Admiral Dewey, while early, yellow in flesh
and good in quality, is not always a freestone and has several other defects
which make it nearly worthless as a commercial fruit. Thus, though the
trees are very productive, the peaches run small, are so heavily pubescent
as to be unattractive, are very susceptible to brown-rot and are often disfigured
with the peach-scab. The trees, too, suffer much from leaf-curl.
With Alexander as the parent, the trees should be hardy, and from
behavior elsewhere, must be so rated; but they have not proved exceptionally
so on our grounds. While nowhere largely planted, Admiral
Dewey is often set, as no doubt it should be, for an early peach in the
home orchard. Of the two early sorts, this variety stands shipment
rather better than Triumph. The varieties are of about the same season,
both coming a week or thereabouts later than the well-known Alexander.</p>

<p>Admiral Dewey was grown from a seed of Alexander by J. D. Husted,
Vineyard, Georgia, in the latter part of the Nineteenth Century. It was
introduced in 1899 by Mr. Husted and has since been grown commercially
east and west, north and south. The American Pomological Society

<p>For nearly a half-century Alexander has been one of the notable early
peaches on this continent, hardiness and vigor of tree contributing with
earliness to make the variety popular. Unfortunately, there are few
fruit-characters to commend Alexander; the peaches run small, the flesh
clings to the stone and is so tender that the two can be separated only with
difficulty, and the quality is poor. Added to the defects of the fruit the trees
have the grave fault of being unproductive. The fruits, too, are very susceptible
to brown-rot but to offset this weakness, the trees are more resistant
to leaf-curl than those of the average variety. Alexander has been more or
less grown in every peach-region on this continent, sometimes attaining
considerable commercial importance, but is now widely cultivated only on
the Pacific Slope, and even here it is evidently destined to pass out before
many years in the competition with newer and better sorts. It is often
confused with Amsden though the two are quite distinct.</p>

<p>Alexander originated soon after the Civil War on the farm of O. A.
Alexander, Mount Pulaski, Illinois. Since 1877 it has been on the fruit-list
of the American Pomological Society. It has been the parent of a
score or more of meritorious extra-early peaches.

<p>Alton is everywhere held in high esteem as an early mid-season, white-fleshed,
semi-free peach. It merits the esteem bestowed upon it by virtue
of large size, handsome appearance and high quality of the peaches and
hardiness and productiveness in the trees. It ripens a little earlier than
Champion, long the favorite white-fleshed peach of its season, does not rot
so readily when brown-rot is rife and hangs longer on the tree in good
condition. It is not, however, quite so choicely good in quality as
Champion, nor, on the Station grounds at least, are the trees quite as
productive. Other faults of Alton are that leaf-curl takes heavy toll on
unsprayed trees, the blossoms open so early as often to be caught by spring
frosts, and the peaches show great variation in size and shape and even in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
texture and flavor. The accompanying cut shows the beauty of the outside
but unfortunately on the grounds of this Station the variety is almost
a clingstone so that the stone could not be separated to permit photographing
the creamy-white flesh, red at pit, and, all in all, most tempting to the
eye. Alton seems to be most at home in the Middle West and South and
is not a familiar inhabitant of eastern orchards as a commercial product.</p>

<p>This variety originated with T. V. Munson, Denison, Texas, a quarter-century
ago and was introduced by him under the name Minnie. By
some it is supposed to have come from Alton, Illinois, and to have been
introduced as Emma but this is an error. Munson's Minnie was tested
at the Illinois Experiment Station from which place Stark Brothers Nursery
Company, Louisiana, Missouri, received it and propagated it under the
name Alton. In 1909 the American Pomological Society placed the variety
upon its list of fruits as Alton, a name which usage makes preferable to
the first one, Minnie.</p>

<p>Arp is the earliest good yellow peach. This is the chief reason for its
cultivation though it has other good characters beside earliness to give it
a place among yellow peaches. At this Station the trees are healthy,
vigorous, productive and hardier in bud than the average, the buds having
withstood the cold of two test winters. The round-oval shape and shallow
suture give it a pleasing appearance of rotundity. To its shapeliness, add
a skin creamy-yellow, heavily blushed with red and covered with short,
thick pubescence with the sheen of velvet, and you have a beautiful
peach&mdash;well shown in the color-plate. The flesh is light yellow, firm,
juicy, sweet, rich, and of excellent quality, but unfortunately clings rather
tenaciously to the stone. The season of Arp is from a month to five weeks
earlier than Elberta and for so early a peach is remarkably long. It is
somewhat susceptible to brown-rot. We do not know from experience
how the fruit will ship but believe it will stand the wear and tear of transportation
and markets as well as any of the standard peaches. Arp ought
to be in every home orchard. Attention is called to the fact that the
June Elberta in the hands of some growers is Arp.</p>

<p>Arp originated with C. P. Orr, Arp, Texas, about 1897. Elberta is
supposed to have been one of the parents while the other may have been a
peach of the Indian type. The variety was introduced by the originator
about 1902.</p>

<p>Belle elicits praise from all who know it because of the great beauty
of its fruits. At its best it is one of the glories of the peach-orchard, the
fruits being large, trim in contour, creamy-white, with a beautiful crimson
cheek&mdash;truly voluptuous in form and color. The color-plate&mdash;made in
a poor season&mdash;falls far short of doing the fruits justice in size and art
cannot depict the soft tints of red and cream which make Belle so beautiful.
The fruits are as enticing to the eye inwardly as outwardly, the white
flesh being delicately marbled, tinted with red at the pit and the flesh and
pit usually part cleanly. Unfortunately, appearance misrepresents quality;
for the variety, while good, falls short in flavor, and the flesh is stringy so
that it must be rated as not above the average for its type. The trees are
large, open-headed, a little straggling, fast-growing and hardy, though,
like most of its type, easy prey to leaf-curl. Belle prefers a southern
climate and in the South is often a good commercial sort but in New York
is grown only for local markets and home use, hardly equalling Champion
as a white-fleshed peach for distant markets.</p>

<p>Belle came from a seed of Chinese Cling planted in 1870 by L. A.
Rumph, Marshallville, Georgia. The other parent is unknown but it is
supposed to have been Oldmixon Free, a tree of which stood near the
Chinese Cling tree. The variety came to notice about the same time
as Elberta and has been thought by some to be a seedling of Elberta.
The American Pomological Society listed Belle in its catalog in 1899 as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Georgia but in 1909 changed the name to Belle and it is so designated in
horticultural treatises but popularly it is "Belle of Georgia."</p>

<p>As it grows at this Station, Bequette Free makes a favorable impression
because of the flavor and attractive appearance of the fruit. It is not a
new variety, however, and the fact that it seems to have been rather widely
and well tested without receiving general commendation except on the
Pacific Slope is against its having a place in the list of desirable peaches
for the Eastern States. The trees are fast-growing, very vigorous, hardy
and densely clothed with foliage but cannot be called fruitful and are,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
possibly, a little too susceptible to leaf-curl. The color-plate shows the
fruit to be a little more irregular than it is in nature.</p>

<p>This variety originated about 1860 in a seedling orchard of Benjamin
Bequette, Visalia, California. J. H. Thomas of the same place named
the sort and first propagated it about 1877. In 1899 the American
Pomological Society added the variety to its list of fruits under the name
Bequett Free but in 1909 corrected the spelling to Bequette Free.</p>

<p>When at its best Berenice is hardly surpassed in quality by any other
peach but it seems capricious, in the North at least, and this, with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
fact that it is none too attractive in coloring, is probably the reason why
the variety is not more grown. The trees are about all that could be
desired, falling short chiefly in not being as productive as several other
peaches of its season and in being a little susceptible to leaf-curl. The
variety has been offered to fruit-growers a sufficient length of time to
have had its merits well tried as a commercial peach and the fact that
it is not now largely grown is presumptive evidence that it has little
commercial value. Its high quality makes the variety a good sort for
the home collection at least.</p>

<p>Berenice originated some thirty or more years ago with the late Dr.
L. E. Berckmans of Augusta, Georgia. It is supposed to have sprung

<p>Blood Cling is the favorite curiosity of the peach-orchard and as
such we accord it a color-plate and a full description in <i>The Peaches of
New York</i>. Unfortunately, the beet-red color of the flesh could not be
reproduced with sufficient accuracy to make the attempt satisfactory. It
is a pleasant peach to eat out of hand and is much used for pickling and
preserving, for which purposes it has real merit. The round-headed, compact
tree might make the variety a desirable parent in breeding new
peaches.</p>

<p>This peach is an American seedling raised many years ago from the
Blood Clingstone of the French. The fruit is much larger than that of
the parent sort but otherwise is much the same. The Blood Free raised
by John M. Ives of Salem, Massachusetts, while somewhat of the nature
of Blood Cling, is, nevertheless, a different sort. The American Pomological
Society listed Blood Cling in its catalog in 1871 under the name
Indian Blood Cling. In 1897 this name was changed to Blood Cling.</p>

<p>Blood Leaf is a handsome ornamental. Its beet-red leaves in early
spring and its pink blossoms, borne in great profusion, entitle it to esteem
for both foliage and flowers. It is worth growing as well for its fruits.
The color-plate opposite page 78 shows the flowers and the accompanying
illustration depicts the fruit-characters. The peaches are in no way
remarkable and yet they please some as a dessert fruit. Seedlings springing
up under two trees of this variety in the Station orchard in 1913, furnished
interesting data on the inheritance of the blood-red color in the leaves
of this peach. Out of 252 young trees, 189 were red-leaved and 63 green-leaved&mdash;an
exact three-to-one ratio to show that the green color is carried
as a recessive.</p>

<p>Several stories are told of the origin of this peach. One is that on
the battlefield of Fort Donelson, Kentucky, a southern general, fatally
wounded, sucked the juice of a peach and threw the stone into the little
pool of blood which flowed from his side. From this pit in its bloody
seed-bed sprang the tree with its blood-red leaves. John L. Hebron, in
a letter published in <i>Gardener's Monthly</i>, 1873, tells a different tale.
According to Hebron the variety was found by P. I. Connor in 1866 at
Champion Hills, Mississippi, on the battlefield where General Tilghman
was killed, a tree having sprung up close to the spot where the General
died. The variety is sometimes called the General Tilghman peach. Leaving
fable and coming to facts, we find that the variety originated in
Mississippi in the sixties and was introduced to the trade in 1871.</p>

<p>Brigdon is a local variety which possibly local pride puts too much
in evidence in assigning it a place among the major varieties in <i>The Peaches
of New York</i>. Still, it belongs with the Crawfords, aristocrats among
peaches, and this is enough to give it standing in a home collection at
least. In tree and fruit it is similar to and a worthy rival of Early Crawford
and has the same two fatal faults to bar it from commercial plantations&mdash;the
trees are capricious as to soils and are often unproductive.
On the other hand, a character of the tree to commend it to the amateur
is that it is one of the least susceptible of all peach-trees to leaf-curl. The
variety is well known only in western New York and is going out in this
region.</p>

<p>Brigdon originated more than a quarter-century ago in Cayuga County,
New York, and has been grown since more or less extensively on the shores
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
of Seneca Lake. The name Garfield was given to this peach by some
one but why or when does not appear. The variety was added to the
American Pomological Society's recommended list of fruits in 1899, a
distinction it has since held.</p>

<p>Since its introduction some twenty-five years ago, Canada has been
a standard early peach in the northern states and more particularly in
the peach-growing region along Lake Ontario in Canada where it originated.
The variety has few characters to commend it excepting earliness and
hardiness though the trees often load themselves with fruit. The peaches,
though small, are attractive in color which is bright red on a light background.
The red is well shown in the color-plate though the fruits
illustrated are rather smaller than usual. Canada is about the poorest
of all peaches in flavor. The fruits are firm and ship well for a white-fleshed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
peach making, so many maintain, a better commercial variety
than its rival, Alexander. On our grounds Canada is freer from rot than
Alexander and the flesh does not cling as tightly. All agree that the tree
is very hardy. However, there ought to be but small place in the peach-lists
of nowadays for a variety so poor in quality and with fruits of such
inferior size as those of Canada.</p>

<p>The variety originated as a chance seedling more than a quarter-century
ago with A. H. High, Jordan, Ontario, Canada. It is often known
as Early Canada and is not infrequently confounded with Amsden and
Alexander, varieties of the same season.</p>

<p>Though Captain Ede has been under cultivation forty-six years it
has but recently come into prominence and seems now to find favor quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
generally as a money-making peach. Those who recommend it say that
the trees are vigorous, heavy bearers and that the crop is uniform and
always fair, smooth and without culls. The crop matures in a short time,
ships well and is in demand in the markets either as a dessert peach or
for culinary purposes. On the Station grounds, Captain Ede comes up
to the reputation given it in all respects excepting productiveness&mdash;here
it is a shy bearer. The peaches, as the color-plate shows, are beautiful,
the flavor is subacid but rich, with a distinct smack of the almond. Captain
Ede ripens with Early Crawford, a week or ten days before Elberta.
The tree, as it grows here, can hardly be distinguished from that of Elberta.
We should unhesitatingly recommend Captain Ede to New York peach-growers,
were it not for the fear that it does not accommodate itself to
a diversity of soils and climates. It does rather better farther south.</p>

<p>Captain Ede originated in 1870 as a seedling in the door-yard of
Captain Henry Ede, Cobden, Illinois. Later, it was introduced by George
Gould and Son, Villa Ridge, Illinois. The parentage of the variety is
unknown. By some, Chinese Cling is supposed to have been one of the
parents and others give the same credit to Honest John. The American
Pomological Society added Captain Ede to its fruit-list in 1909.</p>

<p>Among the many white-fleshed peaches of recent introduction, few
hold a more conspicuous place than Carman. Possibly its chief asset
is a constitution which enables it to withstand trying climates, both north
and south, and to accommodate itself to a great variety of soils. Thus,
we find Carman a very general favorite in nearly every peach-region on
this continent. Besides its cosmopolitan constitution, there is much merit
in the fruits especially for a peach ripening so early. While of but medium
size (the color-plate does not do justice in showing the size of Carman)
the peaches are most pleasing in appearance. The color is a brilliant red
splashed with darker red on a creamy-white background. The shape is
nearly round and the trimness and symmetry of the contour make the
variety, especially when packed in box or basket, one scarcely surpassed
in attractiveness of form. Carman is rated as very good in quality for
a peach of its season though a smack of bitterness in its mild, sweet flavor
condemns it for some. The habit of growth is excellent, peaches are borne
abundantly, brown-rot takes comparatively little toll and in tree or bud
the variety is remarkably hardy. All in all, Carman is one of the most
useful peaches of its class and season for either home or commercial
planting.</p>

<p>Carman grew from a seed planted in 1889 by J. W. Stubenrauch,
Mexia, Texas. The tree fruited in 1892 and its earliness and freedom
from rot so pleased Mr. Stubenrauch that he at once began propagating
the new variety, naming it Pride of Texas. Later, in 1894, the name was
changed to Carman in honor of the late E. S. Carman, long editor of the
<i>Rural New Yorker</i>. In 1909 the American Pomological Society added
Carman to its list of fruits as one of its recommended varieties.</p>

<p>Chairs is a select fruit in the Crawford group, in its turn the most
select of the several groups of peaches. In quality Chairs is unapproachable
by varieties outside of its own family and is not surpassed by any
within its group. The variety was at one time a standard late, yellow-fleshed,
freestone, market peach competing in popularity with Late Crawford
over which it often held ascendency because less subject to brown-rot.
The coming of the showier and more productive but less well-flavored
varieties of the Elberta type has driven the Crawford group from the
markets and Chairs is now known only in collections where it will long be
treasured for its delectable quality. Unproductiveness and capriciousness
in soil and climate, faults of all Crawford-like peaches, are marked in
Chairs. The fruits are usually larger than the specimens shown in the
accompanying illustration.</p>

<p>Chairs originated about 1880 in the orchard of Franklin Chairs, Anne
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Arundel County, Maryland. First called Chairs' Choice, the apostrophe
was dropped in 1891 by the American Pomological Society and still later
the same organization shortened the name to Chairs. Its horticultural
value was early appreciated by all pomologists and it has long been a prime
favorite.</p>

<p>Champion is the white-fleshed peach <i>par excellence</i> in quality&mdash;rightly
used as the standard to gauge the quality of all other white-fleshed peaches.
The fruits are nearly as attractive to the eye as to the palate but unfortunately
run small and off color in all but choicely good peach-soils. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
peaches are not only very good in the characters that make up quality&mdash;tender
flesh, juiciness, pleasant flavor&mdash;but there is a peculiar honeyed
sweetness possessed by few other peaches which gives the Champion
individuality. The color, barring a slight excess in yellow, is well shown
in the color-plate but the size as shown is small. The tree of Champion
is almost perfect from the ground up, few other varieties surpassing it in
height and girt and none, on the Station grounds at least, equalling it
in the quantity and the luxuriant green of its foliage. A Champion tree
is known by its foliage as far as the eye can distinguish color. As would
be expected from the tree-characters given, in soils to which it is suited,
Champion rejoices in vigor and health as do few other varieties. The
variety surpasses most of its orchard-associates in productiveness but the
peaches are inviting prey to brown-rot and the trees are sometimes
defoliated with leaf-curl so that, with its capriciousness as to soils, it has
grave faults as a commercial variety. Because of high quality of the
fruit and the beauty of the tree, Champion should have a conspicuous
place in the orchard of the amateur.</p>

<p>Champion is a seedling of Oldmixon Free supposedly fertilized by
Early York. The original seed was planted about 1880 by I. G. Hubbard,
Nokomis, Illinois, and the variety was introduced by him and by the
Dayton Star Nurseries in 1890. In the early years of its dissemination
Champion was confused with an early, semi-cling variety which originated
in western Michigan and which was locally sold for a time under the same
name. The American Pomological Society added Champion to its fruit-list
in 1897.</p>

<p>Chili, long familiar to the older generation of peach-growers as Hill's
Chili, is now waning in popularity though for nearly a century it was one
of the mainstays of peach-growing, having been widely and commonly
planted in commercial orchards the country over. Chili, in its day, was
one of the notable culinary peaches, being especially desirable for canning
and curing because of its firm, dry, but well-flavored flesh, and, besides,
it ripened late in the season when cool weather gave storage conditions
and made culinary work more agreeable to housewives. The peaches are
not at all attractive in size, color or shape, are quite too dry of flesh to
eat with pleasure out of hand and are made even less agreeable to sight
and taste by pubescence so heavy as to be woolly. The trees of Chili
are about all that could be desired, for, while of but medium size, they
are vigorous, very hardy, long-lived and, barring injury from cold or
frost, are annually fruitful, though the variety has the fault of ripening
its crop unevenly&mdash;an asset in home orchards, a liability in commercial
plantings.</p>

<p>Chili came into cultivation early in the Nineteenth Century, the first
tree probably having appeared in the orchard of Deacon Pitman Wilcox,
Chili, Monroe County, New York. It comes almost true to seed and
several seedlings have sprung up which are almost indistinguishable from
it. Among these are Sugar, Stanley Late, Jenny Lind and Cass. Chili
was mentioned by the American Pomological Society in 1856 as a worthy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
sort under the name "Hill's Chili"; placed under this name on the fruit
list in 1873; and changed to Chili in 1897.</p>

<p>Chinese Cling holds a high place in the esteem of American pomologists
for its intrinsic value, because it was the first peach in one of the
main stems of the peach-family to come to America, and because it is the
parent, or one of the parents, of a great number of the best white-fleshed
peaches grown in this country. The variety is not now remarkable for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
either fruit- or tree-characters, being surpassed in both by many of its
offspring, except, possibly, in quality. The flavor is delicious, being finely
balanced between sweetness and sourness, with sweet predominating, and
with a most distinct, curious and pleasant taste of the almond. The fruits
are too tender for shipment and very subject to brown-rot. The trees
are weak-growers, shy-bearers, tender to cold and susceptible to leaf-curl.
Chinese Cling created a sensation in pomology when it was brought to
America because it was very different from any other peach then here
and was superior to any other in several characters. Its seedlings quickly
came into prominence with the result that possibly a hundred or more
of the varieties named in <i>The Peaches of New York</i> have descended from
it. The attempt to hold it and its seedlings in a distinct group fails, as
we have tried to show in discussing groups of peaches, because through
hybridization they are hopelessly confused with other stocks. The color-plate
is an excellent illustration of Chinese Cling.</p>

<p>Chinese Cling was found growing in the orchards south of the city
of Shanghai, China, by Robert Fortune, the indefatigable English botanist,
who was sent to China by the London Horticultural Society to collect
useful and ornamental plants. Fortune sent the peach to England in
1844 under the name Shanghai, a name which it retains, with variable
spellings, in Europe. Chinese Cling was imported as potted plants to
America in 1850 by Charles Downing through a Mr. Winchester, British
consul at Shanghai, China. Downing forwarded one of the trees to Henry
Lyons, Laurel Park, Columbia, South Carolina, with whom the variety
first fruited in America. Lyons called the new fruit "Chinese Peach."
In 1871 the American Pomological Society placed Chinese Cling on its
recommended list of varieties, a place it still holds.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is enough to say that Chinese Free is Chinese Cling with
a free stone&mdash;at least it has been so heralded. On our grounds, however,
leaves, flowers and fruits are all smaller and the quality of the fruit is
not nearly as good while the tree runs a little better in most characters.
This, perhaps, is a good example of many of the seedlings of Chinese
Cling&mdash;the influence of another parent and the stimulus of hybridization
are apparent. Chinese Free is surpassed by many other white-fleshed
peaches of its season for both home and market. Doubt has arisen
as to whether the tree on the Station grounds is the true Chinese Free,
yet we think it is the variety now commonly going under this name.</p>

<p>This variety grew from a seed of Chinese Cling in the orchard of
W. P. Robinson, Atlanta, Georgia, nearly forty years ago. Mr. Robinson
first exhibited it before the Georgia Horticultural Society in 1881 as an
unnamed seedling. Thereafter it was sometimes known locally as Robinson
but commercially it has always been called Chinese Free. In 1891 the
Georgia Horticultural Society formally adopted the latter name. The
American Pomological Society listed Chinese Free on its fruit-list in 1891
but dropped it in 1897. In 1909, however, another change in heart caused
the Society's officials again to list it in the catalog where it still remains.</p>

<p>Climax is a honey-sweet, freestone peach supposedly adapted only
to the far south. The trees on the grounds of this Station seem as hardy
as the average and are as productive. Whether or not the peaches are
as large and as attractive here as in Florida, where the variety is a commercial
sort, we cannot say but certain it is, Climax has no commercial
value in New York. The peaches are small, unattractive in color, drop
badly, are disfigured by peach-scab and have only honeyed sweetness to
recommend them. We figure and describe the variety in full only to
show that honey-fleshed peaches can be grown this far north and to call
attention to the possibility and desirability of using peaches of this stock
in breeding to improve the quality or give new flavors to northern peaches.
It would, too, give pleasant variety and add quality to the home orchard.</p>

<p>Climax is a seedling of Honey but neither the date of origin nor the
name of the originator is known. The variety was introduced by G. L.
Taber, Glen Saint Mary, Florida, in 1886. The American Pomological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Society added Climax to its fruit-list in 1891 but dropped it in 1899. In
1909, however, the variety was replaced in the Society's catalog as a peach
of merit for the South.</p>

<p>Of the several virtues which entitle Crosby to the esteem of fruit-growers,
possibly the most notable is hardiness in tree and bud so marked
that it is often called the "frost-proof" peach. It is doubtful, however,
whether it is hardier than other peaches of its kind as Chili, Smock and
Heath Cling. Besides hardiness, the trees have to recommend them
vigor, health and productiveness, the latter character offset somewhat
by small size. The quality of the fruit is excellent. The rich, yellow,
freestone flesh is delicious to the taste either as a dessert or as a culinary
fruit. In these days of showy fruits, however, Crosby falls far short in
appearance, the peaches running small, being somewhat irregular and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
covered with dense tomentum. Still, at its best, in soils to which it is
perfectly suited, the peaches are often handsome. But there lies another
fault, the variety accommodates itself but poorly to trying soils and
climates, failing especially in hungry soils and dark climates. The variety
is noted for its willowy growth, small leaves, small flowers, small pits and,
as has been said, hardiness. It is an ideal home sort.</p>

<p>Crosby was sent out about 1876 by a Mr. Crosby, a nurseryman of
Billerica, Massachusetts. Later the Massachusetts Agricultural College
propagated and distributed it in a small way in northern Massachusetts
where it was known as Excelsior. The fact that there was another variety
called Excelsior made a change necessary and the peach was renamed in
honor of Mr. Crosby. The American Pomological Society placed Crosby
on its list of recommended varieties in 1897.</p>

<p>Davidson is on probation as an early peach for northern climates
with the chances greatly against its ever proving worthy the attention
of New York peach-growers. Still, it comes so highly recommended that
we give it a place among the major varieties in <i>The Peaches of New York</i>
hoping that the growers of the State will at least try it out. It is a white-fleshed
peach similar to the well-known Rivers, larger in size, but not quite as
early. The trees are very hardy, come into bearing early and bear heavily
but ripen their crop unevenly. The peaches, as the color-plate shows, are
handsome, and for a variety of early season they are particularly good
in quality but are very susceptible to brown-rot, peach-scab, leaf-curl and
seemingly all the other ills peach-flesh is heir to.</p>

<p>Davidson originated with G. W. Davidson, Shelby, Michigan, and
is supposed to be a sport of Early Michigan, being very similar to that
sort in all respects except season, Davidson being two weeks earlier. It
is often confused with Eureka.</p>

<p>Unproductiveness and uncertainty in bearing keep Early Crawford
from being the most commonly grown early, yellow-fleshed peach in
America. In its season, when well grown, it is unapproachable in quality
by any other peach and is scarcely equalled by any other of any season.
The peach has all of the characters that gratify the taste&mdash;richness of
flavor, pleasant aroma, tender flesh and abundant juice. Besides being
one of the very best in quality it is one of the handsomest peaches.
Unfortunately, this Station is one of the many places in which Early
Crawford is not at home and the accompanying illustration is far from
doing the variety justice in size, shape or color. At their best, the fruits
are larger, more rotund and more richly colored than shown in <i>The Peaches
of New York</i>. In soils to which it is well adapted the peach is large,
often very large, roundish-oblong, slightly compressed, distinguished by
its broad, deep cavity, rich red in the sun, splashed and mottled with
darker red, and golden yellow in the shade. The flesh is a beautiful,
marbled yellow, rayed with red at the pit and perfectly free from the
stone. The trees are all that could be desired in health, vigor, size and
shape but are unproductive and uncertain and tardy in bearing. Yet
with these faults Early Crawford, for at least a half-century, was the
leading market peach of its season giving way finally to white-fleshed sorts
of the Belle, Carman and Greensboro type. Fast passing from commercial
importance, Early Crawford ought long to be grown in home
plantations because of the beauty and unexcelled quality of the fruit.</p>

<p>Early Crawford came into existence in the orchard of William Crawford,
Middletown, New Jersey, early in the Nineteenth Century. Its
merits were first set forth by William Kenrick in the <i>American Orchardist</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
in 1832. The variety in some manner found its way to Europe and came
into the hands of Ferdinand Gaillard, a nurseryman at Brignais, Rhone,
France, but without a name. Gaillard, believing it to be a new sort,
gave it the name Willermoz in honor of M. Willermoz, Secretary of the
Pomological Congress of France. Later, French pomologists decided that
Gaillard's peach and Early Crawford were identical. The American
Pomological Society put this peach on its fruit-list in 1856 under the name
Crawford's Early. The name has several times been varied but today
the variety is listed as Early Crawford.</p>

<p>Early York is entitled to a place among the leading varieties of
peaches only because of the part it played in the beginning of the peach-industry
in America. As the history which follows shows, it was one of
the first named varieties to be grown in this country. It is of more than
passing interest, too, because it is one of the few sorts with glandless leaves.
The fruits of Early York are insignificant, though the color-plate hardly
does the variety justice, but the vigorous, healthy, compact trees have
much to recommend them so that the variety might be used as a stepping-stone
in improving tree-characters of peaches.</p>

<p>No doubt several distinct varieties have been grown as Early York.
Large York, for example, which originated with Prince at Flushing, New
York, has probably been more often sold for Early York than any other
sort. Early Purple, a very old peach of European origin, was introduced
to America about the time Early York came to notice. In some manner
this variety has been confused with Early York, the name often being
given as a synonym of that variety. The two sorts, however, are distinct
and the error of connecting the name has led to much misunderstanding.
Early Purple disappeared from American cultivation soon after its introduction
and peaches sold under this name today are probably Early York.
A controversy has arisen as to the origin of Early York, both America and
England having been given as its home. That Early York is of American
origin, however, there can be little doubt. Its parentage, the time and
place of origin, however, are unknown. It may have come in existence
in New York, or possibly New Jersey or, as some have thought, near
York, Pennsylvania. The variety was sent to Europe about the middle
of the Nineteenth Century where Thomas Rivers grew it at Sawbridgeworth
and from it raised several promising seedlings. The leaves of the
variety are distinctly serrated, giving rise to the name Serrate Early York.
Red Rareripe, another variety having serrated, glandless leaves, has often
been confused with Early York. The two are very similar but the fruit
of Red Rareripe is larger, broader and ripens about a week later. Early
York was placed on the list of recommended fruits at the National Convention
of Fruit-Growers in 1848 and since that time has had a place on
the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society.</p>

<p>In fruit Edgemont is not easily distinguished from Late Crawford,
the essential differences being that the fruits of Edgemont are more rotund
than those of Late Crawford and the flavor is a little more acid. The
trees differ, chiefly, in the greater productiveness of Edgemont and in
a little later maturity of the crop. Of the score or more peaches of the
Crawford type, in many respects the best of the several types of peaches,
Edgemont is distinctly superior to all on our grounds. Compared with
Elberta, with which it must compete in the markets, it is several days
later, is juicier, less fibrous, much excels that variety in quality and,
though the individual peaches are not quite as large, at Geneva the yield
of fruit is even greater. If Edgemont proves adapted to as wide a range
of climates and soils as Elberta, we shall have a new commercial peach
of very great value. Whether it succeeds in commerce or not, Edgemont
is well worth planting in home orchards by virtue of the exceptionally
high quality and attractive appearance of the fruit.

<p>Elberta leads all other peaches in number of trees in New York and
in America. It is, too, the most popular of all peaches in the markets.
A study of the variety, though it reveals some shortcomings, justifies its
popularity with orchardists and marketmen. The preeminently meritorious
character of Elberta is its freedom from local prejudices of either soil or
climate&mdash;it is the cosmopolite of cultivated peaches. Thus, Elberta is
grown with profit in every peach-growing state in the Union and in nearly
all, if not all, is grown in greater quantities than any other market peach.
The second character which commends Elberta to those in the business
of peach-growing is fruitfulness&mdash;barring frosts or freezes the trees load
themselves with fruit year in and year out. Added to these two great
points of superiority are ability to withstand, in fair measure at least,
the ravages of both insects and fungi, large size, vigor, early bearing and
longevity in tree, and large, handsome, well-flavored fruits which ship
and keep remarkably well.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>Elberta, however, is not without faults and serious ones. The trees
are not as hardy in either wood or blossom as might be wished. In northern
regions peaches of the Crosby, Chili, Smock and Wager type stand winter
freezes and spring frosts much better. The blossoms open rather too
early in New York. The peaches also fall short in quality. They lack
the richness of the Crawfords and the sweetness of the white-fleshed Champion
type. Moreover, the pronounced bitter tang, even when the peaches
are fully ripe, is disagreeable to some. Picked green and allowed to ripen
in the markets, Elberta is scarcely edible by those who know good peaches.
The stone is large but is usually wholly free from the flesh. With these
faults, the dominance of Elberta is not wholly desirable as growers have
a feeling of sufficiency with the one variety and consumers are forced to
put up with a peach none too high in quality. Still, since no other variety
is so reliable for the trade, this, by the way, being about the only variety
suitable for export by reason of shipping qualities, Elberta promises long
to continue its commercial supremacy.</p>

<p>Elberta was grown by Samuel H. Rumph, Marshallville, Georgia,
from a seed of Chinese Cling planted in the fall of 1870. The Chinese
Cling tree stood near Early and Late Crawford trees and trees of Oldmixon
Free and Oldmixon Cling. Mr. Rumph believed that the Chinese Cling
blossom which produced Elberta was fertilized by pollen from Early
Crawford. The seedling was named Elberta in honor of Mr. Rumph's
wife, Clara Elberta Rumph. An interesting coincidence connected with
the origin of Elberta is that another stone from the same Chinese Cling
tree was given to L. A. Rumph and from this grew Belle, the splendid
white-fleshed, freestone peach. Nurserymen and growers frequently produce
strains of Elberta which they think superior to the older sort but
the several strains which have been tested on the grounds of this Station
have not proved to differ a whit from the old variety. From the number
of so-called "Early Elbertas" and "Late Elbertas" it may be suspected
that occasionally Elberta, because of some local condition, ripens its fruit
prematurely, or that ripening may be delayed; when removed from the
particular local environment, ripening time seems to occur normally.
Elberta was placed on the American Pomological Society's fruit-list in 1889.</p>

<p>Engle is almost a counterpart of the well-known Late Crawford from
which it differs essentially in earlier ripening fruit and more productive
trees. Before Elberta became the vogue, Engle stood high in the esteem
of commercial planters in Michigan and its culture was rapidly spreading
into other states but the coming of Elberta stopped its career. There
seems little doubt but that Engle is more productive than either of the
two Crawfords, splendid peaches which fail because of unproductiveness,
and for those who want the best it is as good as any of this group&mdash;quite
too good to be lost. One of the faults of the two Crawfords is that
the trees are tardy in coming in bearing. Engle is said to bear younger.
On the Station grounds the fruit drops rather too readily but we do not
find this fault mentioned by others.</p>

<p>Engle was grown some forty years ago by C. C. Engle, Paw Paw,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
Michigan, with a number of seedlings, several others of which proved
valuable. Late Crawford may have been the seed parent but of this
there can be no certainty. The American Pomological Society added
Engle to its list of recommended fruits in 1909.</p>

<p>In the South where Eureka originated, the variety seems to have a
very good reputation as an early, white-fleshed, semi-free peach. In New
York the variety ripens early, when there are many other good peaches of
its type, and it is therefore doubtful if it will ever have a prominent place
in peach-growing in this State. As the variety grows on the Station
grounds, one quality, in particular, marks Eureka as worthy more attention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
than it now receives&mdash;the peaches are exceptionally uniform in size.
The color-plate, by the way, shows shape and color very well but does not
give a fair idea of the size, as the peaches grow larger in average years.
Though long grown, Eureka is worthy further trial in New York.</p>

<p>Eureka is a seedling of Chinese Cling found nearly half a century ago
in Bossier Parish, Louisiana. It was introduced by L. T. Sanders and
Son, Plain Dealing, Louisiana.</p>

<p>Family Favorite is one of the well-known peaches in the South-Central
States but in most respects falls far short of Champion, with which it must
compete, in New York. The tree is doubtfully hardy and the fruit scabs
badly. The variety has two characters to commend it and to give it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
standing among commercial peaches in New York: Compared with that
of Champion, the fruit stands shipment much better and when brown-rot
is rife, does not suffer nearly as much. In selected locations, then,
when a mid-season, white-fleshed peach is wanted, this variety is worth
trying.</p>

<p>Family Favorite is a seedling of Chinese Cling, possibly crossed with
Oldmixon Free. It was raised by the late William H. Locke, Bonham,
Fannin County, Texas. The exact date of its origin is unknown. The
variety was named and introduced by T. V. Munson, Denison, Texas.
The American Pomological Society added Family Favorite to its list of
fruits in 1909.</p>

<p>Compare the color-plates of Fitzgerald and Early Crawford and it
is seen at once that the two peaches are almost identical in fruit and foliage.
There could be no use in growing Fitzgerald in this State, so similar is it
to the better-known Early Crawford, were it not for the fact that the two
differ in season a few days and that possibly Fitzgerald is the more productive
of the two. Fitzgerald ripens a few days earlier than Early
Crawford though in some of the references given it is said to ripen a few
days later. Canadian peach-growers claim that Fitzgerald, besides being
more productive and extending the season of Early Crawford, is hardier.
In the effort to maintain peaches of the Crawford family in commercial
plantations it may be worth while to try Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald originated a quarter of a century or more ago at Oakville,
Ontario, but who the originator or what the parentage is not known.
The American Pomological Society placed Fitzgerald on its list of recommended
fruits in 1899, a place it still holds.</p>

<p>Foster is another very good peach of the Crawford type and at one
time was widely grown in all northern peach-regions. It is so similar
to Late Crawford that even experienced growers can hardly tell them
apart. Those who grow the two in the same orchard find the essential
differences to be: Foster is the larger peach, is more rotund, somewhat
more flattened at the base, is a little earlier, possibly handsomer and is
even of better quality than Late Crawford; the trees of Foster, however,
are hardly as productive as those of either of the two unproductive Crawfords.
This unproductiveness is the fault that keeps the variety in the
background as a commercial peach. The variety is well worth planting
in any home orchard.</p>

<p>Foster originated about 1857 with J. T. Foster, Medford, Massachusetts,
from the stone of a peach purchased by him in a Boston market.

<p>General Lee is a white-fleshed clingstone, the fruit none too attractive
and surpassed by that of other varieties of its season in quality. It is
without value in the North. Southern growers say General Lee is an
improved Chinese Cling and as such well worth growing under some conditions.
It has the reputation of being quite susceptible to brown-rot.
The variety is offered by a good many nurserymen and we discuss it only
to condemn it for planting in New York. The variety, as its history
shows, really belongs to eastern Asia and thus arouses interest.</p>

<p>General Lee originated with Judge Campbell, Pensacola, Florida,
from pits brought from Japan in 1860. In 1864 P. J. Berckmans received
buds from R. R. Hunley of Alabama and in 1867 introduced the sort under
the name General Lee. The American Pomological Society listed this
peach in 1889 as General Lee but in 1897 shortened the name to Lee and
so it appears in the Society's catalog at the present time. We prefer the
old name since when shortened it loses all significance as a commemorative
appellation.</p>

<p>Once one of the mainstays of American peach-growing, George IV
is now of but historical interest. This variety was one of the first named
American peaches and had the honor of being placed on the recommended
list of fruits at the first meeting of the National Convention of Fruit-Growers,
an organization which became the American Pomological Society,
in 1848. George IV is not worth planting now and is illustrated and
described in <i>The Peaches of New York</i> only that fruit-growers may note
progress in the development of peaches. It is interesting to note that this
old American peach is still widely grown in Europe.</p>

<p>George IV has been confused with several other sorts, particularly
Morris Red. Prince, in the <i>Magazine of Horticulture</i>, writes that Morris
Red is an old Red Rareripe brought to America from Europe by Huguenot
emigrants and that George IV came from buds of the original tree of this
variety. The consensus of opinion, however, among those who early
knew both peaches, is that Morris Red and George IV are distinct and that
both are of American origin. George IV, the best authorities say, sprang
up as a chance seedling, about 1821, in the garden of a Mr. Gill, Broad
Street, New York City. After fruiting, the variety rapidly grew in favor
and within a few years was everywhere grown in eastern America. Taken
to Europe, it soon became one of the standard European peaches. From
the first it was on the list in the American Pomological Society's fruit-catalog
but was dropped in 1897 to be replaced in 1909. We doubt if it
now deserves to be recommended on any list of fruits.

<p>Gold Drop, long a familiar variety in Michigan peach-orchards, is
not much grown elsewhere. It is doubtfully worth planting in New York
as a peach of commerce but should find a place in every home orchard.
The variety has several distinctive peculiarities which make it a pleasing
variation in the peach-orchard and add to its merits as a home fruit.
Thus, its transparent, golden skin and flesh make it one of the handsomest
of all peaches; add to handsome appearance a somewhat distinctive
flavor&mdash;vinous, rich, refreshing&mdash;and the peach becomes one that all
agree is very good and one that, were the size larger, would sell in any
market. Gold Drop is further characterized by great hardiness in tree
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
and bud and by remarkable productiveness. Indeed, it loads itself so
heavily that the peaches invariably run small unless the trees are heavily
pruned and the crop thinned&mdash;small size of fruit is the greatest defect
of the variety. Besides being one of the hardiest of all peaches it is also
about the least susceptible to brown-rot and leaf-curl, the two worst
scourges of the peach when yellows permits the trees to live. Earliness
in coming in bearing is another admirable character. The trees are of
but medium size, are dainty in habits with clean, fresh foliage so that
the variety is an attractive ornamental. All in all, Gold Drop is ideal
for the home garden and has many good characters which can be used
as stepping-stones in breeding peaches.</p>

<p>The origin of Gold Drop is unknown. It is evidently an old sort
and some horticulturists believe it to be an old variety renamed. The
variety has been cultivated in Michigan orchards for many years under
the name Golden Drop given it by George W. Griffin, Casco, Allegan
County, Michigan, who introduced it. The variety was at one time
supposed to be the peach which is grown in Michigan as Yellow Rareripe
but it is not the Yellow Rareripe cultivated today. The American Pomological
Society listed it in its fruit-catalog in 1909 under the name Gold
Drop.</p>

<p>Were it not that Governor Hogg must compete with the well-established
Greensboro and Carman, we should say at once that it was well
worth trying in commercial planting in New York as an early, white-fleshed
peach. In the Station orchard, Governor Hogg ripens a few days
after Carman, is larger, handsomer and as good in quality. In both
appearance and quality, Governor Hogg excels Greensboro, the size, shape
and color of the two, as the illustrations show, being much the same
though the color of this variety runs more to reds and soft tints of red.
The flesh is firm, though tender and delicate, and the peaches ought to
stand shipment well. As with all of these early, white-fleshed peaches,
Governor Hogg is quite susceptible to both leaf-curl and brown-rot.</p>

<p>The parentage of this peach is unknown. It seems to have originated
with a Mr. McClung, Tyler, Texas, about 1892, and was disseminated
by Messrs. Sneed and Whitaker of the same place. The American Pomological
Society placed Governor Hogg on its fruit-list in 1909.</p>

<p>Greensboro is one of the leading early, white-fleshed peaches. It
takes high place because of its showy fruits and its large, vigorous, healthy,
early-bearing and prolific trees. In the last character, in particular,
Greensboro is almost supreme&mdash;year in and year out, barring accidents,
its trees are fruitful. Possibly, too, no other white-fleshed peach is adapted
to a greater variety of soils than Greensboro which, with fair capacity to
stand heat and cold, makes it suitable for wide variations in peach-regions.
The peaches, while handsome, as the color-plate shows, are in no way
remarkable, the quality, if anything, being rather inferior, so that it is
the tree that gives Greensboro its standing. The variety is well thought
of by fruit-dealers not only on account of the attractive product but
because the fruits carry well and keep long. Possibly the peaches are
less susceptible to brown-rot than most other varieties of Greensboro's
season but to offset this advantage there are many cracked pits and
accompanying mal-formed fruits. Picked green the stone clings; picked
at maturity the variety may be called a freestone. All in all, Greensboro
is one of the best early, market peaches for New York.</p>

<p>Greensboro is a seedling of Connett grown by W. G. Balsey, Greensboro,
North Carolina, about 1891. It was introduced by John A. Young
of Greensboro as Balsey, this name being changed to Greensboro in 1894.
Greensboro was added to the list of fruits recommended by the American
Pomological Society in 1899.</p>

<p>In the middle of the last century, Hale Early was considered the
best peach of its season for home and market. Even now it has several
characters to recommend it; as, large, vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive
trees, fruits handsome in color, uniform in size and shape, with flesh more
than ordinarily free from the stone for an early peach, fair quality for
the season and extreme earliness. The chief fault is that the peaches run
small in size, scarcely exceeding large marbles, which they resemble in
roundness. The variety must be grown in the best of peach-lands, heavily
thinned, and the trees severely pruned. The peaches, besides being small,
are very susceptible to brown-rot. Nowhere very commonly planted, the
variety is still widely distributed, a fact, in view of the competition with
many early peaches, which speaks well for a peach introduced more than
fifty years ago. It is interesting to note that Hale Early was introduced
into Europe many years ago and that European pomologists still speak
highly of it.</p>

<p>Hale Early grew from a seed planted in 1850 by a German named
Moas at Randolph, Portage County, Ohio. A few years later the attention
of a Mr. Hale, Summit County, Ohio, was called to the seedling and he,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
impressed with its earliness, began to propagate it. About 1859 the
variety was introduced by Hale and Jewett, nurserymen in Summit County,
as Hale's Early German. In some localities it became known as Early
German but finally the name Hale's Early was adopted. It was so listed
in the American Pomological Society's fruit-catalog in 1862 but in 1891 the
name was changed to Hale so to remain until 1909 when it appeared
in the Society's catalog as Hale Early. The adoption of the last name
is warranted, possibly, from the fact that another peach named Hale
existed several years before the origin of the present sort.</p>

<p>Heath Cling is unquestionably the oldest named American peach
now under cultivation. Its antiquity constitutes about its only claim to
recognition though for its tree-characters and for at least one fruit-character
it ought to be retained for breeding. Few varieties have larger,
healthier, hardier trees than Heath Cling, the fact that the oldest of our
peaches has from the first retained these characters in pristine vigor
confuting the notion that varieties degenerate. In the descriptions of
Chinese peaches in Chapter 1, we read of winter peaches&mdash;sorts that
could be kept for three or four months after picking. Of all American
peaches, Heath Cling, possibly, most nearly approaches these Chinese
winter peaches. It has been known to keep in good condition from
October to December. Its quality, at best, is good but often it runs poor.
Well grown, the peach has a sweet, rich, vinous taste but the flesh adheres
so tightly to the stone that it is not pleasant eating out of hand though
splendid cooked, preserved or pickled, the stone in culinary operations
imparting a pleasant flavor of peach-pit bitterness. It is the best of all
peaches to preserve or pickle whole. The color-plate shows the blushed
sides of Heath Cling and therefore too much red for typical specimens
of this variety.</p>

<p>Just how old Heath Cling is no one knows but it probably was grown
in the colonies before the Revolution. Two accounts are given of its
origin. According to one it originated with Daniel Heath of Maryland
from a pit brought from the Mediterranean. Another is that the honor
of originating this peach belongs in the Prince family and that the first
William Prince discovered the variety growing wild on the farm of Judge
Willet, Flushing, New York. The Princes, according to this account,
gave it the name Heath because it was found on a barren heath. It
seems fairly well established that the variety was in the Prince orchards
before the Revolutionary War whether or not it was found and named
by them.</p>

<p>Heath Free is now rarely planted, being replaced by better sorts&mdash;in
fact it was out of date a quarter-century ago when the American Pomological
Society dropped it from its fruit-list. We can see no justification
of the Society's action in restoring the variety to its list ten years later.
The tree-characters of Heath Free seem to be, in the main, very good
but the peaches are not at all attractive in appearance and none too good
in quality&mdash;at best it is but a culinary sort. Possibly it is worth growing
under some conditions as a late, white-fleshed peach.</p>

<p>Heath Free is another old variety, a native of New England. Kenrick,
one of the first American pomologists, received the variety from General
Heath, Roxbury, Massachusetts, early in the Nineteenth Century. Later,
Kenrick sent it to Prince at Flushing, New York, who is credited with
having distributed it. The variety should not be confused with Heath
Cling. Ripening at the latter end of the peach-season, the term "Late"
is often attached to the name. In 1862 the American Pomological Society
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
put this peach on its fruit-list under the name Kenrick Heath but dropped
it from the list in 1899. Ten years later, 1909, the variety was replaced
in the Society's catalog as Heath Free.</p>

<p>In spite of keen competition with many other early, white-fleshed
peaches, there seems to be a place for Hiley. Two characters make it
notable in its class. It is the earliest commercial freestone, white-fleshed
peach and it is rather better in quality than most of its competitors. Well
grown, the peaches are large in size and handsomely colored but the
fruits are not quite as uniform in either size or color as could be desired
for a commercial variety. The trees, while productive, are neither large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
nor sufficiently hardy and vigorous to make an ideal commercial sort.
Still, we must end as we began, with the statement that there is a place
for Hiley because of earliness and high quality. The fruits, unfortunately,
are easy prey to brown-rot.</p>

<p>Hiley originated with Eugene Hiley, Marshallville, Georgia, about
1886. Seeds of several varieties, including Belle and Elberta, were planted
and from these sprang one tree which bore the fruit under discussion.
R. A. Hiley, who seems to have first discovered its value, is of the opinion
that this variety is a seedling of Belle crossed with Alexander. The new
peach was first named Early Belle and the first crops were shipped under
this name. Later the name was changed to Hiley. The American Pomological
Society placed the variety on its fruit-list in 1909.</p>

<p>Coming at a season when there are several very good, white-fleshed
peaches, we doubt whether Hynes can establish itself in the peach-list
for New York. The peaches are not quite large enough and the stone
clings a little too tenaciously for a first-class early peach. The flavor
is good for an early peach and when large enough the fruits are attractive,
shape and coloring being particularly pleasing. Hynes was at one time
highly recommended, widely advertised and largely sold in New York by
nurserymen and fruit-growers in this State. We doubt if many are now
planting it. The color-plate is an excellent reproduction of the variety.</p>

<p>Hynes was grown about 1877 by E. F. Hynes, West Plains, Missouri.
Its parentage is unknown. The variety soon became disseminated as a
valuable early, commercial peach. At first it was known as Hynes Surprise
but gradually the name has been shortened to Hynes. The late S. D.
Willard, Geneva, New York, grew and recommended this variety for a
number of years and by some has been given the credit of having originated
and introduced it. The American Pomological Society put Hynes on its
fruit-list in 1899.</p>

<p>Illinois is a mid-season, white-fleshed, freestone peach, still on probation
with what result as to commercial possibilities we should not like
to predict. It has been little tried in New York and growers in other
peach-regions are not in accord as to its value. In size, color and shape
of fruit, as the color-plate shows, Illinois is one of the beauties of the
orchard. Yet, all things considered, the new variety is not as good
as Champion with which it would have to compete. Neither tree- nor
fruit-characters are quite satisfactory as the variety grows on the Station
grounds. It must be apparent, too, to all peach-growers that the industry
is overloaded with white-fleshed peaches which at best must be sold in
nearby markets or grown for home use.</p>

<p>Illinois originated about 1910 on the grounds of E. H. Riehl near
North Alton, Illinois. It is supposed to be a cross between Stark Heath
and Washington.</p>

<p>Of the several honey-flavored peaches fruiting on the Station grounds,
Imperial is probably the best. The fruit is not easily distinguished in
appearance from that of Climax, at least by those unfamiliar with southern
peaches, and is also rather closely allied to Honey in outward character but
has a somewhat distinct flavor in which it surpasses Climax and Honey.
It differs from both, too, in time of ripening. The peaches of this, as of
other honey-flavored sorts, drop badly as they mature. It is doubtful
if we shall ever grow pure-bred peaches of the Honey type in New York
for the markets, but Imperial, at least, is worth a place in every home
orchard where it does not have to brave too great a degree of cold; and
peach-breeders should seize the opportunity to cross it with our less richly
flavored northern varieties.</p>

<p>Imperial is a seedling of Honey grown in 1890 by G. L. Taber, Glen
Saint Mary, Florida. This variety has been much confused with White
Imperial, a sort grown in New York many years ago but long since out of
cultivation. Pomologists frequently list White Imperial as a synonym
of Imperial, giving the origin as New York, when the variety in mind is
the true Imperial of southern origin. Imperial was listed in the American
Pomological Society's catalog in 1897 but was dropped in 1899. It
appears again, however, in the Society's catalog in 1909 under the name
Imperial with White Imperial incorrectly given as a synonym.</p>

<p>Hardiness is the outstanding character which has brought Iron
Mountain into prominence. The introducer and many growers claim
extreme hardiness of wood and bud for the variety&mdash;others say that it
is surpassed by Crosby, Wager and other varieties of their type. The
trees on the Station grounds turned out not to be true to name so that
we can offer no data as to hardiness. Iron Mountain is a very late, white-fleshed,
freestone peach well adapted for extending the commercial limits
for this fruit in regions where fall frosts hold off sufficiently long for the
fruit to ripen. The tree-characters are reported by most growers as very
satisfactory and the peaches serve very well for culinary purposes but
are not sufficiently attractive for a dessert fruit though the quality is
excellent. There seem to be two varieties, much alike in fruit, passing
under this name; one is large-flowered, the other small-flowered. This
variety might well be planted in New York for some markets; as, for
example, near towns and cities where it is desirable to extend the local
market as late as possible.</p>

<p>Iron Mountain seems to have originated in New Jersey about a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
quarter-century ago but nothing is known of its parentage or by whom grown.
The variety was introduced by J. H. Lindley, Whitehouse, New Jersey. It
was put on the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society in 1909.</p>

<h3>J. H. HALE</h3>

<p>Of many new peaches, J. H. Hale is now the leading aspirant for
pomological honors. Indeed, it is one of the sensations of the pomological
world, the variety having many merits to commend it and the
name and fame of the originator and of the introducers, together with
extensive advertising, helping much to bring the peach to the attention
of fruit-growers. Elberta is now the standard commercial peach and,
since J. H. Hale must make its way in competition with the variety in
command of the markets, we can best set forth the characters of the new
sort by comparing it with Elberta with which all are familiar. The
comparison is easy to make, for the two peaches are of the same general
type, Elberta, probably, being one of the parents of J. H. Hale.</p>

<p>In size of fruit, J. H. Hale averages larger&mdash;all things considered
a trifle too large when the trees are at their best. The flesh of J. H. Hale
is firmer and heavier and the peaches will ship and keep longer than those
of Elberta. In shape, the fruit is almost a perfect sphere, its symmetry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
being scarcely marred by the suture so that it is more shapely than the
oblong Elberta and can, of course, be packed to better advantage. The
color-plates of the two peaches show the differences in shape very well.
In color of fruit there is no choice&mdash;both peaches are voluptuously
handsome. The skin of J. H. Hale is less pubescent and possibly a little
firmer and tighter, characters adding to the appearance and shipping
qualities of the fruit. It is but an invitation to argument to say which
is the better in the characters that go to please the palate&mdash;flavor, aroma,
texture and juiciness. Neither, in comparison with many other peaches,
can be rated as extra good.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we cannot be as certain of the merits of the trees of
the two varieties as we are of the fruits. This much we know, J. H. Hale
is a few days earlier than Elberta and its trees and buds are hardier than
those of Elberta. Which is the more productive is not certain and this
can be ascertained only when data can be had from a large number of
growers since productiveness in both is bound to vary with the soil. The
greatest asset of Elberta is its ability to adapt itself to diverse soils; whether
J. H. Hale is equally elastic in constitution remains to be seen. The
variety is still on probation in New York with the chances growing stronger
each year that it will take high place among commercial peaches. We
do not expect it to drive Elberta from the markets but the markets will
be shared between the two, J. H. Hale reaching the fruit-stands several
days in advance of Elberta. Would that there were as good a commercial
variety to follow Elberta.</p>

<p>This remarkable variety is a chance seedling found by J. H. Hale,
South Glastonbury, Connecticut. From its characters, one sees at once
that it is either an offspring or is very closely related to Elberta&mdash;at
first many thought the two were identical. After having thoroughly
tested the new variety in commercial orchards in both Connecticut and
Georgia, Mr. Hale decided that it was worth introducing and sold the
new peach to the William P. Stark Nurseries, Stark City, Missouri. The
distribution of the variety was begun in 1912 and possibly no other tree-fruit
has ever been so rapidly propagated and so widely distributed as
has the J. H. Hale in the past four years.</p>

<p>Jennie Worthen is given a place among the major varieties in <i>The
Peaches of New York</i> with the hope that New York growers may be
induced to try it as a high-grade, yellow-fleshed, freestone variety to
precede Elberta. It is enough to say that it is very similar to Early
Crawford&mdash;best of all early peaches&mdash;and on the Station grounds is
more productive, unproductiveness being the fault that keeps Early
Crawford from being a money-making variety. Whether or not Jennie
Worthen can be grown commercially, it is well worth planting in the
home orchard.</p>

<p>But little is known of the history of this variety. According to a
letter from the late T. V. Munson, Denison, Texas, it originated in Illinois
with a Mr. Worthen and was named for his daughter. The Munson
Nursery grew the variety for a few years after its introduction but has
since discontinued its propagation.</p>

<p>Before peach-growers had Elberta, Kalamazoo was a promising yellow-fleshed,
freestone variety. The fruit is better in quality than Elberta but
not as showy in appearance and the trees are not quite as productive.
Kalamazoo ripens with Late Crawford and could well compete with that
variety for the trees are hardier in wood and bud and are much more
productive. The variety falls short, however, in the size of the peaches,
these running no larger than a medium Late Crawford, though possibly this
defect could be remedied by thinning. The fruits are of highest quality
either for dessert or culinary purposes. The trees are susceptible to leaf-curl
and must be thoroughly sprayed for this fungus. The variety is grown
rather extensively in Michigan and is well known in parts of New York.</p>

<p>Kalamazoo originated with J. N. Stearns, Kalamazoo, Michigan,
about 1869, as a sprout from below the bud on a Yellow Alberge tree.
It first fruited in 1871 and was exhibited that year at the Michigan State
Fair where it received a premium as the best seedling peach. The
American Pomological Society placed Kalamazoo in its fruit-list in 1899
where it still remains.

<p>Though long grown in parts of western New York, Lamont has not
been sufficiently well tested by the peach-growers of the State. It is a
yellow-fleshed, freestone peach, much like Early Crawford in appearance
and quality, which ripens from one to two weeks after Elberta. It is
more productive than either of the Crawfords and if it does as well elsewhere
as about Geneva, the place of its origin, it ought to take high place
in the list of commercial peaches for this State. Several large growers
in this region speak well of it as a market fruit. As a garden variety for
its season, it can hardly be surpassed.</p>

<p>The original Lamont tree grew as a chance seedling on the grounds

of Charles Lamont, Geneva, New York, first fruiting about 1884. It
was introduced by E. Smith and Sons, Geneva, New York, soon after its
discovery. The variety is offered by several Geneva nurserymen.</p>

<p>Large York long ago lost all value for either home or commercial
plantings but it is still listed in a few nursery catalogs and is still in the
fruit-list of the American Pomological Society. It is one of the old
American sorts and has been much confounded with several other peaches.
We place it among the major varieties in <i>The Peaches of New York</i> chiefly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
to straighten out the nomenclatorial tangle involving it and the several
varieties with which it is commonly confounded.</p>

<p>Large York has been more often confused with Early York than
any other sort. George IV, Haines and Honest John have also been
listed time and again as identical with Large York. While the sorts
mentioned have many resemblances, there are distinguishing characters
for all of them. Large York, known also as Large Early York and Large
Early Rareripe, originated with William Prince,<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> Flushing, New York,
some time in the Eighteenth Century, probably from a pit of Red Rareripe.
The variety was at first called Early York but to distinguish it from
another Early York the term Large was added. Prince sent the variety
to William Forsyth of England about 1790. Forsyth grew it in the Royal
Kensington Gardens and later renamed it Royal Kensington under which
name it is frequently sold in England. While Large York and Early
York are closely related, the leaves of the latter are glandless while those
of the former have globose glands. At the National Convention of Fruit-Growers
held in 1848, Large York was put on the list of recommended
varieties under the name Large Early York. The peach has remained
on the American Pomological Society's fruit-catalog since the date given,
the name being shortened in 1897 to Large York.</p>

<p>Late Crawford is at the head of the Crawford family, long dominant
among the several groups of American peaches and not yet equalled by
any other yellow-fleshed peaches in quality. Late Crawford, a quarter-century
ago, began to give way to Elberta because of the greater
productiveness of the Elberta tree and the showier Elberta fruits and
now, though widely distributed, is nowhere largely planted and seems
destined to pass out of cultivation as a peach of commerce. Unproductiveness
and tardiness in coming in bearing are the faults on account of
which Late Crawford is failing. Itself adapted to a wide range of soil
and climatic condition, Late Crawford, through the recurring variations
from seed, has made the Crawford family the most cosmopolitan of the
several distinct races of American peaches. Of all the family it is most
virile, more than a score of its offspring being described in <i>The Peaches of
New York</i>.</p>

<p>Compared with other Crawford-like peaches, Late Crawford is possibly
the best in fruit-characters, the peaches being unsurpassed in appearance
and scarcely equalled in texture of flesh and richness of flavor. The
peaches, too, are more shapely and more uniform in shape than fruits of
other Crawford varieties, being rounder, trimmer in contour and having
a suture that scarcely mars the symmetry of the peach. In color, Late
Crawford runs the whole gamut of soft tints of red and yellow that make
Melocotons and Crawfords the most beautiful of all peaches. The trees
are as vigorous, hardy, healthy and as little susceptible to disease as
any of the varieties near of kin, failing only, as has been said, in productiveness
and in coming in bearing rather tardily. Evidently destined to
pass from commercial cultivation, Late Crawford ought long to remain
one of the treasures of the home orchard.</p>

<p>Late Crawford was raised by William Crawford, Middletown, New
Jersey, at least a hundred years ago, the exact date of origin, as well as
its parentage, being unknown. The variety was first brought to notice
by William Kenrick, Newton, Massachusetts, who described it in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
<i>American Orchardist</i> under the name Crawford's Superb Malacatune. No
doubt it has a worthy line of ancestors in the old seedling orchards of the
early colonists, the fact that it is the founder of a race indicating long-continued
reproduction from seeds with little interposition of budding.
At the National Convention of Fruit-Growers held in 1848, Late Crawford
was placed in the list of recommended fruits and since that time has held
a place on the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society. It was
first listed as Crawford's Late; later as Crawford's Late Melocoton and
now appears as Late Crawford in accordance with the Society's rules of
nomenclature.</p>

<p>Late Rareripe is a white-fleshed, late freestone. It is of value now only
because of its historical interest though its high quality makes it well
worth growing in gardens. Its position as a milestone in the progress of
peaches is better marked if we quote A. J. Downing<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> who wrote in 1845
when Late Rareripe was in its prime and one of the leading varieties:
"Unquestionably one of the very finest of all peaches. Its large size,
great excellence, late maturity, productiveness, vigor, all unite to recommend
it to universal favor. We cannot praise it too highly."</p>

<p>This old variety is certainly of American origin but the originator,
the time and place of origin are all unknown. It has been cultivated more
than a hundred years. Prince believed it to be a seedling of Red Rareripe
but there is nothing to be found now to verify this belief. Late Rareripe
was sent to France in 1855 where it has since been grown as a satisfactory
commercial sort. The American Pomological Society listed this
variety in its catalog in 1862 under the name Late Red Rareripe. In
1897, the name was shortened to Late Rareripe as it now appears.</p>

<p>Lemon Free is a yellow-fleshed, freestone, lemon-shaped, lemon-colored
peach ripening in late mid-season. The fruit is not sufficiently
attractive in appearance to sell well in the markets and, besides, is too
thin-skinned to ship or keep well. The quality is very good, the flavor
being sweet, rich and delicious, though possibly the flesh is a little too dry
to permit the variety being ranked as "very good." It is an excellent
peach for culinary purposes having the reputation of making a handsomer
canned product than any other peach. Lemon Free is little grown in the
eastern states but it is one of the leading sorts of its season in parts of
California. The color-plate shows the shape very well but the color is
not quite that of the real peach.</p>

<p>This variety seems to have originated in Ohio about 1885 but nothing
is known of its parentage, originator or introducer. Wickson, in <i>California
Fruits</i>, claims California as its birthplace but this, we think, is an error.
In 1889 the American Pomological Society placed Lemon Free in its fruit-catalog
as Lemon but in 1899 changed the name to Lemon Free.</p>

<p>This variety ripens quite too late for any but the most favorable
peach-sections in New York. It is a round, yellow-fleshed clingstone of
very good quality and might be planted in the parts of New York, where
the season permits it to mature, for a very late culinary peach. It is one
of the favorite peaches to close the season in Southern fruit-growing sections.</p>

<p>The history of Levy is badly confused. More than half a century
ago a peach called Henrietta was cultivated. Where or when the variety
originated no one can tell. In 1881, Downing mentioned a peach under
the name Levy Late as being a new, late clingstone originating in the
garden of W. W. Levy, Washington, District of Columbia. Downing
gave Henrietta as a synonym of Levy Late, as have several pomologists
since. From these facts, it seems safe to say that the variety is old, that
it was first introduced as Henrietta and that the peach which Mr. Levy
claimed to have originated was Henrietta. The American Pomological
Society, in 1899, added this peach to its fruit-list as Henrietta but in 1909
changed the name to Levy, giving Henrietta as a synonym.</p>

<p>Lola is a popular peach in parts of the South but is hardly known in
New York. On the Station grounds it is the best of its season and one of
the best of all white-fleshed peaches. Moreover, it fills a gap in the peach
procession that ought to make it valuable in this State. It follows Mamie
Ross and Greensboro, both of which it surpasses in appearance and quality.
It precedes Champion and is even better than that handsome and delicious
peach. Since it ripens with the well-known Carman, fruit-growers will
want to know how it compares with that variety. It is hardier in bud
than Carman, that sort not having a single fruit after the cold winter
of 1911-12 while Lola bore a fair crop; the fruit is of better quality, larger,
hardly as well colored and on the Station grounds the tree is more productive.
Attention of New York peach-growers was called to Lola, in words almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
identical with those here used, in Bulletin 364 from this Station, published in
1913, with the result that it is now being tried in several parts of the State
and we shall soon know what its commercial value is this far north.</p>

<p>The parentage of Lola is unknown. The variety originated from
seed planted in 1876 by J. W. Stubenrauch, Mexia, Texas, who named
it Miss Lola in honor of his daughter. The American Pomological Society
listed Lola in its catalog in 1899 as "Lolo." In 1909, however, the spelling
was changed to Lola as it is correctly written.</p>

<p>Mamie Ross seems to have a very good reputation as a table and
market peach in Texas and other parts of the South but is hardly worth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
growing in New York. The fruit has two bad faults: The quality is not
high&mdash;the flesh being coarse, juicy and insipid in flavor; and the peaches
bruise with the least possible handling so that they cannot be shipped to
advantage. On the Station grounds the pubescence, too, is so abundant
as to be objectionable. Mamie Ross comes at a season when there are
many other good mid-season, white-fleshed peaches and may, therefore,
be thrown out of the list for this region. It is, as the color-plate shows,
a very handsome peach.</p>

<p>Mamie Ross is probably a seedling of Chinese Cling. It originated
about 1881 with Captain A. J. Ross, Dallas, Texas. The variety soon
attracted attention and neighbors began propagating it. Later, Mr. Ross'
brother named the peach after the originator's youngest daughter. In
1899, the American Pomological Society added the variety to its fruit-list.</p>

<p>May Lee is a very early white-fleshed, clingstone, pink-cheeked peach
introduced to rival Alexander, Triumph and other extra early sorts. It
fails, on the Station grounds at least, because the peaches run small, the
flesh clings too tenaciously and the stones crack. Neither is the fruit
attractive in color nor high in quality. It may be as good in quality as
Alexander or Triumph but is no better. The variety is but doubtfully
worth planting in New York.</p>

<p>May Lee originated with E. W. Kirkpatrick, McKinney, Texas, from
a seed of Mamie Ross planted in 1896.</p>

<p>Morris White is one of the ancients of American peach-orchards worth
noticing now only because of its worthy past. It is distinguished among
peach varieties by its white flesh&mdash;white clear to the pit with no trace
of red even on the surface or next to the stone. It is further distinguished
by its sweet, rich flavor&mdash;giving it high rank among the best of peaches&mdash;and
by the great productiveness of the trees. Though undoubtedly the
day of Morris White is passed for either commercial or home orchards, it
might still be used advantageously in breeding late, white-fleshed, freestone
peaches.</p>

<p>William Robert Prince,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> in his <i>Pomological Manual</i>, describes a White
Rareripe which he claims originated in the nursery of his grandfather and
which can be no other than the Morris White under discussion. The
origin of the variety will always be in doubt but probably the elder Prince
originated it in the latter part of the Eighteenth Century. Leroy has
confused the history of Morris White with that of Red Rareripe, commonly
called Morris Red Rareripe, which probably originated with Robert Morris,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Leroy questions the identity of the White
Rareripe mentioned by Coxe but, although the season of Coxe's sort is a
trifle earlier than Leroy's, the two are probably the same. There was a
White Rareripe grown for a short time in America many years ago which
proved to be the old French Nivette renamed. Nivette was not widely
disseminated and probably has long since passed from cultivation in
America. Morris White was reported upon at the National Convention of
Fruit-Growers in 1848 and received a place in the list of recommended
fruits. It continued to be listed in the American Pomological Society's
fruit-catalog until 1891 when it was dropped but was replaced in 1897 and
still remains there.</p>

<p>For many years Mountain Rose was preeminent among white-fleshed,
freestone peaches by virtue of high quality and handsome appearance.
It has a distinct and curious but delicious flavor&mdash;a sort of scented sweetness
that appeals to all who appreciate choicely good fruit. Unfortunately,
it fails in the chief requirement for popularity in these days of commercial
fruit-growing&mdash;the trees are unproductive, a fault so marked that the
variety is rapidly passing from cultivation. Mountain Rose sells well
in all markets where it is known, usually bringing a fancy price because of
its extra good quality and because it follows closely after the dozen or
more white-fleshed, clingstones of poorer quality.</p>

<p>The variety originated about 1851 on the farm of a Dr. Marvin,
Morristown, New Jersey. Of its parentage nothing is known. Mountain
Rose has always been considered a good market variety and has been widely
disseminated. The American Pomological Society added this peach to
its fruit-list in 1871, a place it has since held.

<p>As a rule, peaches originating in California find small favor in New
York. California peaches are selected for canning, evaporating and shipping,
whereas New York varieties are dessert fruits. Muir is a California
sort suitable only for culinary purposes&mdash;attractive enough inside but so
unattractive externally that it could tempt no one who did not know the
fruit to be sweet and delicious in flavor. It is a late mid-season, yellow-fleshed,
freestone peach much used by canners on the Pacific slope. It
ought to be more generally grown for the same purpose in the East; for,
as a canned product, it is hardly surpassed in appearance or quality. The
trees are vigorous, productive and little subject to leaf-curl but the fruits
in New York are often marred by peach-scab. The variety seems perfectly
at home in this State as, seemingly, it is in most peach-regions.
In fruit-characters, Muir is very similar to Wager.</p>

<p>The variety was found more than twenty-five years ago on the farm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
of John Muir, near Silveyville, California. G. W. Thissell, Winters,
California, named and introduced Muir. The American Pomological
Society added this peach to its fruit-list in 1899.</p>

<p>Niagara is a variant of a peach which all growers lament as being less
and less grown, the Crawford. The Crawford group, though a dominant
type, is, as we have several times pointed out, a little too capricious as to
soil and climate to suit the needs of commercial peach-growers, failing
to bear regularly or abundantly in most soils. For this reason the once
very popular Early and Late Crawfords are now seldom grown. All who
know these varieties regret that a sort of their type, without their faults,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
has not yet come to light. In New York the best of the comparatively
new Crawford-like peaches is Niagara, said to be a seedling of one of the
Crawfords. The fruit ripens later than Early Crawford, averages larger,
is borne more abundantly and holds its size better to the end of the season.
But Niagara's great point of merit, as compared with Crawford, is that it is
more dependable in all tree-characters, being, especially, less capricious
as to soil and climate. Niagara, as the color-plate shows it, is a beautiful
fruit, yellow, with a handsome over-color of red. The flesh, too, is
attractive and delectable&mdash;yellow, thick and firm, with a rich, sweet
flavor which makes it one of the most palatable peaches of its season.
It is, as are most of its type, a freestone. Niagara fails in productiveness
in some localities, having in this respect the fault of all its tribe; but it
should have a welcome place in any home collection and, where it proves
productive, is one of the best for general market.</p>

<p>Niagara probably came originally from Maryland to Julius Harris,
Ridgeway, New York. Later it was sold to a grower near Lockport, New
York, who disposed of it to a Mr. Corwin, Newfane, Niagara County, New
York, who called it Corwin's Crawford. It then came into possession of the
Rogers Nurseries, Dansville, New York, from whom this Station received
its trees under the name Niagara. It is probably a seedling of Early
Crawford. Niagara was added to the fruit-list of the American Pomological
Society in 1909.</p>

<p>Without question one of the oldest American peaches, going back
at least 150 years, Oldmixon Cling is still well worthy a place in every
orchard where high quality is a prime requisite. It is a rich, luscious, white-fleshed
peach, ripening late, which, besides being excellent in quality for
dessert and culinary purposes, is uncommonly handsome&mdash;a combination
of characters possessed by few other peaches. The color-plate is
almost a perfect picture of the variety and could the flavor be as well conveyed
to readers, Oldmixon Cling might again take on some of its one
time popularity. We can discover but one fault in the fruits as they
grow on the Station grounds&mdash;the pits crack badly. The variety, however,
seems to be passing out because the trees are not, as a rule, fruitful
though in all other respects they are seemingly near perfection.</p>

<p>There is no trace of when, where or how Oldmixon Cling originated.
Coxe<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> first set forth its merits in 1817. It is reported to have been introduced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
from Europe by Sir John Oldmixon but Downing believes that it
was the pit and not the tree which Oldmixon brought to America. At any
rate the variety takes its name from its supposed introducer. If the pit
were planted by Sir John Oldmixon, this must be the oldest of our peaches
for Oldmixon came to America nearly 200 years ago. He was, by the way,
the author of one of the early and notable books on America, <i>The British
Empire in America</i>, published in London in 1741. Pomologists from
time to time have made two words of the name making it appear that
old and new Mixon peaches existed. Oldmixon Cling was placed in the
fruit-list of the American Pomological Society in 1856 and ever since has
retained a place there. In 1881 the Society changed the name from Old
Mixon Cling to Oldmixon Cling.</p>

<p>Oldmixon Free is a variant of Oldmixon Cling, differing, essentially,
as the name implies, in having a free stone; it is, also, more sprightly
in flavor and not quite as well endowed with the characters that constitute
high quality. Side by side, outwardly, the two peaches can hardly
be told apart. Since Oldmixon Cling is sometimes semi-free and Oldmixon
Free often clings more or less, the two are often confused in
orchards and markets. Both of these Oldmixons, as those who live in regions
where cold and frost do frequent damage should know, are as hardy in wood
and bud as any of the white-fleshed varieties. The blossoms of both, too,
appear in late mid-season, thereby often escaping frosts. The trees of
Oldmixon Free, like those of Oldmixon Cling, have the fault of being
unproductive.</p>

<p>Oldmixon Free is supposed to be an American seedling of Oldmixon
Cling, a fruit for the introduction of which we are indebted to Sir John
Oldmixon of early colonial fame. At the Convention of Fruit-Growers
held in 1848, Oldmixon Free was placed on the list of recommended peaches.
In 1856 it appeared in the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society
where it still remains.</p>

<p>Opulent is a white-fleshed, freestone peach of very mediocre character
as it grows on the Station grounds. The fruits are attractive in
appearance but not uncommonly so and are often marred, as they grow in
New York, by peach-scab. The quality is scarcely better than the average
and is ruined for most peach-lovers by a bitter tang, though to others
this almond-like bitterness in the flavor may be a commendation. The
variety ripens in mid-season. The trees are scarcely more satisfactory
on the Station grounds than the fruits, being unproductive and none too
vigorous. The chief claim this peach has to public notice is that it is a
cross between a peach and a nectarine. Though as yet not thoroughly
tried in New York, it is safe to say that it is worthless for this region.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

California, as a hybrid between the Muir peach and New White Nectarine.</p>

<p>Pallas is about the best of the several honey-flavored, beaked peaches
that have fruited on the Station grounds. This is one of the sorts supposed
to thrive only in warm climates but here, in a location none too favorably
situated as to climate, the trees are vigorous, appear to be hardy and differ
from northern varieties, so far as life events are concerned, only in holding
their leaves longer. The fruits run small and lack uniformity in size,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
faults that will not permit Pallas ever to become a commercial sort in New
York. Moreover, the peaches are not attractive in appearance, suffer
terribly from brown-rot and do not ship well&mdash;further disqualifications
for competition in commerce. In quality, especially, to those who have
a taste for sweets, Pallas is almost unapproachable&mdash;so rich, sweet,
aromatic and delicious as well to justify the sobriquet, "Honeydew,"
frequently bestowed upon it. This variety might well be planted in every
home orchard.</p>

<p>Pallas is one of the many seedlings of Honey and originated in 1878
with L. E. Berckmans, Augusta, Georgia. In 1891 the American Pomological
Society added Pallas to its list of fruits as a noteworthy variety for
southern fruit-districts.</p>

<p>Pearson is a newcomer among peaches which will bear watching if
it does as well in other parts of New York as on the Station grounds. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
is a large, handsomely-colored, white-fleshed, freestone peach of good
quality which ripens ten days before Champion. There are, it is true, a
good many white-fleshed peaches at this season but Pearson is an exceptionally
good one, much excelling Mamie Ross with which it might have
to compete although the latter ripens a little later. The trees are very
vigorous, productive and, so far, about as healthy as any on the Station
grounds.</p>

<p>Pearson originated with J. M. Pearson, McKinney, Texas. Its
parentage is unknown. The variety was introduced by E.W. Kirkpatrick
of McKinney, who thinks it may be a seedling of Chinese Cling.</p>

<p>For the history and a discussion of the horticultural characters of
Peento, the reader is referred to page 108. The variety is too tender to
cold to be grown in New York; in fact it succeeds only in Florida and the
warmest parts of the other Gulf States. The American Pomological
Society listed Peento in its fruit-catalog in 1889. The following description,
as it applies to the tree, has been compiled:</p>

<p>Prolific was heralded a quarter-century ago as one of the great
acquisitions to the peach-flora of the country. Time has not dealt kindly
with the variety and it is doubtful if it is as popular now as it was a few
years after its introduction. The trees are very satisfactory, excelling most
of their orchard-associates in vigor, size, health, hardiness and productiveness
but the peaches fall below the mark in several characters. The fruits
are of but medium size and not uncommonly attractive in color, though
handsome enough, but too poor in quality to rate high among the peaches
of its season which is a few days before Elberta. The flesh is yellow, firm,
dry and little attacked by rot. With the qualities just named, the variety
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
is, of course, a good shipper and might be in demand in the markets for
culinary purposes. We doubt whether the peach should be largely planted
in New York.</p>

<p>Further than that Prolific comes from Michigan, nothing is known of
its parentage, the originator or the date of origin. It was introduced about
1890 by Greening Brothers, Monroe, Michigan, under the name New
Prolific. In 1909 the American Pomological Society added this peach
to its fruit-list as New Prolific.</p>

<p>This is another of the many early, white-fleshed, freestone peaches
which are competing for favor among peach-growers. We doubt if Ray,
however, should find a place on the peach-list for New York. Several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
faults condemn it; worst of all, the trees are not productive. Add to
unproductiveness, lack of uniformity in size, shape, color and flavor and
the variety is out of the race as a commercial sort. This far north, too,
the trees suffer from winter injury. The variety is remarkable for its
foliage. Were it not for the fact that Ray is well spoken of in several
other states, and the possibility that it might do better in other parts of
New York than on the Station grounds, we should not place it among the
major varieties in <i>The Peaches of New York</i>. It is said to be an excellent
shipper.</p>

<p>This peach is occasionally confused with Raymond Cling, which
originated in Mississippi many years ago and which has long since passed
from cultivation. The present variety originated with D. Ray, Tyler,
Texas. Its parentage is unknown. The American Pomological Society
placed Ray on its fruit-list in 1909.</p>

<p>For nearly a century, beginning soon after the Revolutionary War,
Red Cheek Melocoton had few rivals among yellow-fleshed, freestone
peaches. Even yet it is surpassed in quality only by members of the
Crawford family of which, by the way, it is supposed to be the immediate
ancestor&mdash;certainly all Crawford-like peaches resemble it in both fruit
and tree-characters. Lack of vigor and unproductiveness have driven
Red Cheek Melocoton from common cultivation&mdash;indeed it is now almost
impossible to obtain the trees. We give the variety attention in <i>The
Peaches of New York</i>, not because of present worth, but because of the
prominent part it has played in the peach-industry of the country in the
past. The color-plate is an admirable reproduction of this old peach
though possibly the fruits run a little larger than in the illustration.
The derivation of "Melocoton," so often used in this text, is given on
page 51.</p>

<p>Red Cheek Melocoton is an American seedling which, according to
William Prince, sprang from a bud of a stock on which Lemon Cling had
been grafted, at the Prince farm, Flushing, New York. The Princes
were so impressed with the seedling that they propagated it, giving it the
name Red Cheek Malacatune, the name Malacatune at that time being
given to all yellow peaches having little red. The discovery of the variety
in the Prince orchards dates back considerably over one hundred years.
From Red Cheek Melocoton the Crawfords and several other notable
peaches are said to have come. In 1867 the American Pomological Society
placed this variety in its catalog as Red Cheek Melocoton but in 1909
shortened the name to Red Cheek. We prefer to preserve the old name.</p>

<p>Reeves is another of the old favorites now rapidly passing out of
cultivation. In its day it was justly celebrated for the high quality of its
yellow-fleshed, freestone fruits which are as handsome as they are palatable.
The peaches have but two minor defects to keep them from perfection&mdash;they
are a little too irregular in shape and sometimes fall short in size.
In texture of flesh, juiciness, taste and aroma they are scarcely surpassed.
The fault that condemns the variety is unproductiveness in the trees.
Under average conditions, Reeves is scarcely as productive as the Crawfords
which are rated by all as about the poorest bearers. Making up in some
degree for unfruitfulness, the trees are vigorous and more than usually
hardy. It can hardly be expected that so poor a bearer will prove profitable
in commercial plantations but Reeves is worthy of perpetuation for
home orchards.</p>

<p>This attractive peach came from a chance seedling found about sixty
years ago by Samuel Reeves, Salem, New Jersey. The variety has for
many years gone under the name Reeves' Favorite and was so listed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
the fruit-catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1875 but in 1909
the name was shortened by the Society to Reeves.</p>

<p>Rivers and one other, Salwey, are the only foreign peaches now commonly
cultivated in America. The peach, of all tree-fruits, best proves
the general rule that American varieties of fruits are best adapted to
American conditions. Perhaps to Rivers may be added three or four more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
exotic peaches which are now and then planted in this country but all are
passing out so rapidly that we shall soon be standing on a basis in peach-growing
which is wholly American. Earliness and high quality of fruit
keep Rivers alive in private places in America. No one would think of
planting it in a commercial orchard because of its small fruit, tender skin
and flesh which show every bruise, and its susceptibility to brown-rot.
It is a white-fleshed freestone, tender, juicy and with an exceedingly rich,
sugary flavor with a savoring smack of the nectarine. This variety stands
almost alone in beauty of flesh which is white to the stone, translucent
and more or less mottled and interspersed with white veins. At its best
the fruits are rather large and quite handsome as they grow in America,
but even so they are but a shadow of the peach described under this name
in European fruit-books. The trees are fairly satisfactory in all essential
characters.</p>

<p>Rivers originated with Thomas Rivers, Sawbridgeworth, England,
about 1865 as a seedling of Early Silver. Soon after its introduction in
England it was brought to America. The American Pomological Society
listed the variety in its fruit-catalog in 1875 as Early Rivers but in 1883
changed the name to Rivers though it is still popularly known as Early
Rivers.</p>

<p>Fruit-growers have long desired an early, yellow, freestone peach
with suitable tree-characters for a commercial plantation. There are
several competitors for the place, the latest of which is Rochester, a member
of the Crawford group and in several respects a marked improvement on
the well-known Early Crawford. Rochester, in season, regarding the crop
as a whole, certainly precedes Early Crawford several days, ripening soon
after the middle of August. The introducers say that it is two weeks
earlier, a statement made possible by the fact that its season is very long,
a few specimens ripening extremely early. The great length of season of
this variety under some circumstances may be an asset, under others a
liability. As the color-plate shows, the peaches are large, yellow, with a
handsome over-color of mottled red, more rotund than either of the two
Crawfords or Elberta, making, all in all, a strikingly beautiful peach.
The flesh, too, meets all the requirements of a good peach&mdash;thick and
firm, marbled yellow, stained with red at the pit, juicy, rich, sweet and in
all respects fully up to the high standard of palatability found in peaches
of the Crawford group. While the variety must be classed as a freestone,
yet there is a slight clinging which may disappear under some conditions
and may be augmented under others. Rochester seems to be sufficiently
productive for a good commercial fruit but it remains to be seen how
generally it is adapted to soils and climates. Should its range of adaptability
be great, Rochester, by virtue of earliness, good quality and handsome
appearance, at once takes a high place in commercial peach-growing in
New York.</p>

<p>Rochester came from a seed planted about 1900 on a farm owned by
a Mr. Wallen, near Rochester, New York. It was introduced by the
Heberle Brothers Nurseries, Brighton, New York, in 1912.</p>

<p>Unproductiveness and uncertainty in bearing keep this magnificent
yellow-fleshed dessert fruit from being one of the most popular early
peaches. Even with these handicaps, to which may be added small size
in many situations, St. John has maintained great popularity for home
orchards and in many peach-regions is grown for the markets. It is one
of the earliest of the Crawford-like peaches, a perfect freestone, handsome
in appearance, sweet, rich and delicious in flavor and pleasing in all of the
flesh attributes of a good dessert peach. St. John resembles Early Crawford
in size and shape but is a little more rotund, runs somewhat smaller,
is not quite as high in quality and ripens several days earlier. The trees
are all that could be asked for in size, vigor and hardiness, falling short
only in the characters noted in the opening sentence. St. John should
always be planted in the home orchard and it would seem that it is more
often worth planting in commercial orchards. The color-plate does not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
do the variety justice in size, color or shape, the Station grounds being
one of the many places in which the variety cannot be had at its best.</p>

<p>Where, by whom and when St. John originated and what its parentage,
are unknown. It is more than half a century old, came from the South,
and has been widely planted in southern peach-districts, especially along
the southern coast of Alabama. The variety reproduces itself from seed
and this fact has led to its being distributed under a number of different
names as is shown by the synonyms listed in the references. In Michigan
the variety was grown for some time as Crane, or Crane's Early Yellow,
having come from the orchard of Charles G. Crane of Fennville.
Mr. Crane, it appears, had lost the true name of the peach and after fruiting
his supposed seedling for a time it was discovered by T. T. Lyon<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> to be
identical with St. John. In 1871 the American Pomological Society added
this peach to its fruit-list as Yellow St. John but dropped "Yellow" from
the name in 1891, the variety having appeared since that time in the
Society's catalog as St. John.</p>

<p>Salwey is one of the two European peaches cultivated on a commercial
scale in America, Rivers being the other. Both find their greatest usefulness
in extending the peach-season, this variety being one of the latest
and Rivers one of the earliest sorts. It is a yellow-fleshed, freestone peach
of attractive appearance and of good quality, neither handsome enough
nor good enough in quality, however, to be considered a first-class dessert
fruit. On the other hand it is one of the best sorts for canning, preserving
and evaporating. The trees are vigorous, hardy, healthy and very productive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
but unfortunately ripen their crop so late in New York that the
variety cannot be depended upon. Early freezes often destroy the fruit
and cold, wet weather usually hinders maturity so much that the peaches
are seldom at their best in this State. Possibly no other peach is more
widely grown than Salwey. It is a standard sort in France, England and
in peach-regions in America from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from
Canada to the Gulf. This uncommon adaptability to diverse soils and
climates ought to make it a valuable sort in peach-breeding. It has the
reputation of coming true to seed but we do not find that many varieties
have come from it.</p>

<p>The history of Salwey is not clear. Pomologists generally credit
Thomas Rivers, Sawbridgeworth, England, with being the originator and
introducer of the variety. It is known that Rivers grew it on his grounds
but it is doubtful if he originated it. Other accounts say that it was
raised in 1844 by Colonel Salwey, Egham Park, Surrey, England, from
the seed of an Italian peach. Some say that a Charles Turner, Slough,
England, brought the Italian peach seed from Florence, Italy, while others
state that Turner introduced the new peach. The variety has long been
known in America as Salway but Colonel Salwey, after whom the peach was
named, spelled his name with an "e" and the correction is made in this
text. In 1875 the American Pomological Society added this peach to its
list of recommended fruits under the name Salway.</p>

<p>Schumaker, now grown only in western New York and Pennsylvania,
for a long time was described as the earliest of the white-fleshed, clingstone
peaches. There are other peaches as early but, on the Station grounds,
this is the best flavored of the early peaches. Moreover, when fully ripe
it is almost a freestone. It is a handsome peach in color and shape but
the fruits are too small though this can be remedied in part by thinning.
The trees are large, hardy, vigorous and productive to a fault. With all of
these good qualities, the wonder is that Schumaker is not more popular as a
commercial variety to open the season but for some reason peach-growers
are not pleased with it&mdash;probably because of the small size of the peaches.
For a peach of its season, Schumaker is remarkably free from brown-rot.
Nurserymen often substitute Alexander for this variety and vice versa.</p>

<p>This variety originated as a seedling with Michael Schumaker, Fairview,
Erie County, Pennsylvania. Its parentage is unknown. It fruited
for the first time in 1877 and was for a few years grown commercially but
its popularity has long been on the wane.</p>

<p>Though little grown now, during the last half of the last century
Smock was one of the leading commercial peaches of its season. The
variety has so little to recommend it, however, that we cannot but believe
that reputation more than merit kept up its popularity. The trees are
about all that could be desired but the peaches are of but mediocre quality
and not at all attractive in appearance, lacking in size and color, are ungainly
in shape and have but little uniformity in size, color or shape. It is one of
the latest yellow-fleshed peaches and is said to be excellent for all culinary
purposes. With so many better varieties of late yellow-fleshed, freestone
peaches, Smock is not worth planting for any purpose.</p>

<p>Smock originated three-quarters of a century or more ago with a
Mr. Smock, Middletown, New Jersey. Variations under such names as
Smock X and Smock (Hance) have arisen as distinct varieties but all
have proved to be identical with the old sort. The name Smock Cling
appears in peach-literature but whether the peach was distinct we cannot
say. Years after the introduction of Smock a peach was put out under
the name "Beers Smock." The differences claimed are that Beers Smock
runs larger and is better in quality than Smock. All descriptions of the
two sorts, however, are so nearly identical that we believe that the two
names are given to the same peach. In 1862 the American Pomological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
Society listed Smock in its catalog as Smock Freestone. In 1873 the name
was shortened to Smock and it so appears today.</p>

<p>Stevens is one of the fruits of the generation just past&mdash;a large, white
and red, white-fleshed, freestone peach. The variety is best known
as Stevens Rareripe but the last part of the name is inapt for the
true rareripes are earlier ripening peaches while with Stevens lateness
is one of its prime assets. In quality the fruits are extra good, the flesh-characters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
pleasing in every respect. The flavor is a pleasing mingling of
sweet and sour not found in many other peaches so late in the season.
The appearance of the peach is as alluring as the taste. The color-plate
shows the variety almost perfectly in color and shape but the peaches as
depicted are rather smaller than the average. These late, white-fleshed
peaches now seldom sell well, usually reaching the markets in poor condition,
but they are choice fruits for home use and for this purpose Stevens
should be planted in every home orchard. The variety has the reputation
of being hardy in both wood and buds.</p>

<p>Stevens originated about 1858 on the farm of B. Stevens, Morristown,
New Jersey. Its parentage is unknown. It was listed in the
American Pomological Society's catalog in 1889 as Stevens Rareripe.
Later the name was shortened to Stevens in accordance with the Society's
rules of nomenclature.</p>

<p>Stump has long been a favorite white-fleshed, freestone, late peach
of the Oldmixon type. It is not a handsome fruit, the color-plate flattering
rather than detracting from its appearance, but makes up in quality what
it lacks in looks. The flesh is melting, juicy, sparkling, rich and good
though dry and very mediocre if permitted to overripen. The peaches
are too tender for distant shipment and the variety is of value only for
local markets and home use. The trees are large, vigorous, hardy, healthy
and productive, with a shapely, upright-spreading, dense-topped head&mdash;about
all that could be desired in a peach-tree. In spite of the high
quality of the peaches and the splendid tree-characters, Stump is steadily
waning in popularity and will, no doubt, soon pass from cultivation.</p>

<p>We can say little of the history of Stump other than that it originated
in New Jersey at least three-quarters of a century ago. A Mr. Brant,
Madison, New Jersey, in a report on peaches at the meeting of the New
Jersey Horticultural Society in 1878 mentions a variety as Stump-of-the-World
which originated on the farm of Samuel Whitehead in Middlesex
County, New Jersey, about 1825. Mr. Brant, however, considered this
sort distinct from Stump although very similar to it. From the description
he gives it seems certain that he was describing the true Stump. In 1862
the American Pomological Society listed this sort in its catalog as Stump
the World. The name was shortened to Stump in 1897 by the committee
on nomenclature in accordance with pomological rules.</p>

<p>Summer Snow is a curiosity with some value for culinary purposes
Its distinctive peculiarities are a skin almost pure white and flesh white
as snow from skin to pit. The quality is poor and the flesh clings to the
pit so tenaciously that the variety has no value, whatsoever, for dessert
but is said to be excellent for pickling and to make a very good and a very
distinctive canned product.</p>

<p>There are no records of the origin of this peach but it is doubtful if
it dates back more than a quarter of a century. The variety is very
similar to the old Snow, which was probably its prototype, differing
essentially in having a clinging stone while the stone of Snow is free. In
New York the name is a misnomer as the fruit does not ripen until the
last of September or early in October. Albino peaches date back to the
early records of this fruit and seem to be known wherever peaches are
grown. Whenever seedling peaches are grown in large numbers, an
occasional albino appears.</p>

<p>As Surpasse grows on the Station grounds, it has most of the qualities
of a first-class yellow-fleshed, freestone peach. The fruits are large,
handsome and of excellent quality, while the trees are satisfactory in every
respect except, possibly, in productiveness. The variety has been grown
sufficiently long in New York to have been well tested and has not found
favor, so that we must conclude that it does not do as well elsewhere as
here and that it is doomed to go into the discard.</p>

<p>Surpasse originated more than forty years ago on the grounds of
Ellwanger &amp; Barry, Rochester, New York, and has long been sold by
this nursery firm. It has never been widely nor largely grown commercially
but is not uncommon in western New York.</p>

<p>Thurber is mediocre in all of its characters in New York, though
perhaps it is a little better in quality than the average white-fleshed,
mid-season freestone. In the South, however, it seems to be considered
one of the best of its class not only in quality but in size and appearance.
The fruits are small in New York, as the color-plate shows, while all
descriptions of them in the South say they are large. The variety is
possibly worth planting, because of good quality, in home orchards in this
State.</p>

<p>Thurber is a seedling of Chinese Cling grown by L. E. Berckmans,
Rome, Georgia, more than forty years ago. The variety was named in
honor of Dr. George Thurber, American botanist, naturalist and editor.
It is similar to its parent but is a freestone and the trees are more compact
and thrifty than those of Chinese Cling. The American Pomological
Society added Thurber to its fruit-list in 1881, a place it still holds

<p>Triana is another of the honey-fleshed, beaked peaches supposed to
thrive only in the far South. It can be grown, however, with about as
much certainty in New York as many of the standard varieties of the North.
Its small size and poor shipping qualities debar it from competing with
commercial peaches in this region but it is well worth planting in home
orchards for the sake of variety and because of its delicious flavor&mdash;a
sort of scented sweetness wholly unknown in northern varieties. The
good health, vigor, size and hardiness of these honey-peaches on the Station
grounds is a constant surprise to those who have believed that they could
be grown only in the Gulf States.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p>Triana originated a quarter of a century or more ago at the Glen
Saint Mary Nurseries, Glen Saint Mary, Florida. It was introduced in
1892 by the originators. The American Pomological Society added Triana
to its fruit-list in 1909.</p>

<p>Triumph is an extra early, yellow-fleshed peach so inferior in
appearance and quality of fruit and so subject to brown-rot that it is not
worth growing in any but the most northern peach-regions where, because of
great hardiness in wood and bud, it becomes a valuable variety. It is grown
more or less, however, both north and south because it is one of the earliest
yellow-fleshed sorts and because the trees bear regularly and abundantly.
The dark color and the great amount of fuzzy pubescence detract materially
from the appearance of the peach. The specimens shown in the color-plate
are from unthinned trees; the size can be increased by thinning.
Small pits somewhat offset the small size of the fruits. The peaches, if not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
attacked by brown-rot, stand shipment splendidly, a character which adds
to its value for early markets. Though often put down as a clingstone
it is, when well grown, a semi-cling and sometimes the stone is free.</p>

<p>Triumph is one of several seedlings grown by J. D. Husted, Vineyard,
Georgia. It is supposed to be an offspring of Alexander. The date of
origin is unknown but references go back to 1895. Triumph was placed
on the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society in 1899.</p>

<p>Troth, the standard early peach in the middle of the last century, is
now all but out of cultivation. It is still listed in a few nursery catalogs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
and is still on the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society. Among
the multitude of early peaches now grown, Troth cuts but a sorry figure
in either tree- or fruit-characters. It is worth discussing here only because
it is a milestone in the evolution of cultivated peaches.</p>

<p>Troth, first known as Troth's Early Red, originated in the first years
of the Nineteenth Century, probably in New Jersey. Nothing is known
of its parentage or of the originator. It ripens with Early York and some
pomologists have confused it with this variety and also with Haines but,
while similar to both, Troth is distinct. The American Pomological Society
placed the variety upon its fruit-list in 1862 under the name Troth's Early
Red but dropped it in 1891. In 1899 it was once more recommended by
the Pomological Society, being listed as Troth.</p>

<p>Waddell is an early mid-season, white-fleshed, semi-cling peach from
Georgia, a very evident descendant of Chinese Cling. The variety is now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
widely grown and is everywhere esteemed as a commercial sort. Its chief
competitor is Carman, compared with which the fruit differs in ripening
a few days early; is handsomer, in color at least, the two, as the color-plates
show, being very similar in size and shape; is of rather finer texture
of flesh and is better flavored; and, lastly, according to most reports,
Waddell is a better shipper than Carman. The variety has not been nearly
as widely nor as generally planted as the better-known Carman but we are
of the opinion that it has been a greater factor in the success of a score or
more of the big commercial peach-orchards, North and South, of the last
few years. It is a particularly pleasing peach in New York and ought to
be considered for every commercial plantation where a variety of its
season is wanted to precede or to compete with Carman.</p>

<p>Waddell is a chance seedling found by William Waddell, Griffin,
Georgia. The variety was introduced by J. H. Hale, South Glastonbury,
Connecticut. The American Pomological Society added Waddell to its

<p>Hardiness, productiveness and early bearing are the outstanding
characters of Wager that give it a high place in the peach-list for New
York. It is a yellow-fleshed, freestone peach none too attractive in coloring,
always rather small and of only fair quality as a dessert fruit but
excellent for canning, drying and all culinary purposes. The variety comes
true to seed, or nearly so. The fruits of Wager are not attractive enough
and the trees are too small to make the variety of much value in commercial
plantations but it is a very good peach for home orchards and one
of the best of all where hardiness is a prime requisite. Several quite distinct
peaches are sold by nurserymen as Wager.</p>

<p>Wager originated some time previous to 1870 with Benjamin Wager,
West Bloomfield, Ontario County, New York. The variety was added to
the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society in 1897.</p>

<p>Waterloo is without honor in its own country but is a standard peach
in England. In spite of the fact that the variety originated within ten
miles of the Station grounds it is all but worthless here as it is in most parts
of New York. Waterloo is an extra-early, white-fleshed, semi-cling peach
very similar to the better-known Canada. The faults that condemn it
are small size, poor quality, susceptibility to brown-rot and a long period
of ripening for the fruit and small size and unproductiveness in the tree.
It is given prominence in <i>The Peaches of New York</i> only because it is so
often noted in the horticultural press as a standard variety, an opinion,
no doubt, reflected in America from European publications.</p>

<p>Waterloo was first grown by Henry Lisk, Waterloo, Seneca County,
New York, who brought it to notice in 1877. Thomas Rivers introduced
it into England where it has long been grown and esteemed for its earliness
and good quality. The American Pomological Society placed Waterloo
in its fruit-catalog in 1885, where it remained until 1891 when it was
dropped, but was replaced in 1897.</p>

<p>Wheatland is a large, yellow-fleshed, freestone peach of excellent
quality which ripens just before Late Crawford. Although the variety
originated in this State it is little grown here now, being somewhat more
popular westward in Michigan and very much grown in Colorado and
Utah. The fruit is about all that could be desired in New York but the
trees are so unproductive that the variety is nowhere grown in this region
with profit. The beauty and high quality of the fruit might make it
desirable for home orchards.</p>

<p>Wheatland is a chance seedling found about 1870 on the grounds
of Daniel E. Rogers, Scottsville, New York. The variety was placed
on the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society in 1883.</p>

<p>A century ago Yellow Rareripe was at the head of the list of yellow-fleshed,
freestone peaches&mdash;largest, handsomest, hardiest and best-flavored
of all. Even now in fruit- and tree-characters, with the single exception
of productiveness, Yellow Rareripe holds its own very well with the peaches
of its type and season. A glance at the color-plate shows the peach to be as
attractive as any in color and shape; the size is above the average and in
texture and flavor it is not often surpassed. Its fault is unproductiveness,
to make up for which the trees usually bear regularly and come in
bearing early. The variety is now hardly worth planting commercially
in New York, being equalled by several yellow-fleshed peaches in all
characters and surpassed in productiveness by many, but, if the trees can
be obtained, it might find a welcome place in home orchards. Yellow Rareripe
seems still to have all of the vigor and vitality of the first trees, helping
thereby to furnish evidence that varieties do not run out.</p>

<p>This is another American peach the origin of which is involved in so
much uncertainty that it is impossible to state where, when and by whom
produced. Prince claims to have discovered the original Yellow Rareripe
tree near Flushing, New York, over a hundred years ago. It was being
grown in the vicinity of Boston early in the Nineteenth Century where
it seems to have been first introduced by William Kenrick, Newton, Massachusetts,
under the name Yellow Red Rareripe. Occasionally another and
inferior peach, Yellow Melocoton, was substituted for Yellow Rareripe.
Hovey received peach-trees from Kenrick under the name Cutter's Yellow
which later proved to be Yellow Rareripe. Hovey retained the name
Cutter's Yellow, because it was briefer. The Marie Antoinette, mentioned
by Kenrick in 1841, is without question Yellow Rareripe and has
been listed as synonymous by several authors. Yellow Rareripe was
placed in the American Pomological Society's fruit-catalog in 1862 where
it has since remained as a recommended variety.

Probably from this variety have sprung the Melocotons and Yellow Rareripes of this
country. Rossanna, though very similar to Alberge, differs from it in having reniform
glands and in ripening about two weeks later. In some sections, especially around
Rochester, New York, Alberge is known as Barnard's Rareripe. The variety was placed
on the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society in 1862 but was dropped in 1891.
Tree moderate in growth; leaves crenate; glands globose; flowers small, rose-colored; fruit
medium in size, nearly globular; suture and cavity deep; skin yellow, almost entirely
covered with deep red or purple; flesh deep yellow, red near the stone, melting, juicy,
vinous; of second quality; pit large, oval, terminating in a short point, brownish-red, free;
ripens in the middle of August.</p>

<p>Bourdine is an old French sort written of by Merlet and Quintinye. It has been
confused with Royale, Louis XIV having so named it on receiving it from his gardener,
Bourdine. Duhamel maintains that these two are distinct varieties and we have followed
him. Leaves with globose glands; flowers small, edged with carmine; fruit large, roundish,
halves unequal; suture deep and wide; skin greenish-white, blushed and marbled; flesh
white, melting, separates readily from the pit, sugary; quality good; stone small, nearly
round; ripens the middle of September.</p>

because of its similarity to No. 16, the latter is often substituted for it. The true Early
Michigan is a cross between Hale Early and Chili. As it fruits at this Station, the peaches
lack size and quality. In 1909 the American Pomological Society added it to its fruit-list.
Tree vigorous, spreading; glands reniform; flowers appear early, large, showy; fruit

was raised by a M. Desse, Chantecoq, Seine, France, and passed for a long time under the
name Desse Hâtive. Early Purple long found favor in European orchards but is not much
grown now, being surpassed by better sorts. It was brought to America by William Prince,
Flushing, New York, early in the Nineteenth Century and soon became confused with
Early York. The true variety, however, quickly passed from cultivation and the name
has ever since been confused with that of Early York. Fruit medium to large, roundish,
flattened at the base; suture deep; color yellowish, blushed with dark red and dotted with
red on the shaded side; pubescence thick, fine; flesh white, stained red under the skin on
the side exposed to the sun, tinged with red next the pit, juicy, vinous, highly flavored,

<p>The numerous synonyms for this variety are an evidence of the esteem in which it
was long held. It undoubtedly originated in France; according to Leroy it was mentioned
by Merlet in 1667. During the reign of George the Third, Grimwood, of the Kensington
Nursery, sent it out as Grimwood's Royal George. A Mr. Lee of Hammersmith, England,
called it Early Vineyard; Shailer, of Chelsea, Superb Royal; Forsyth, a royal gardener at
Kensington in 1784, called it Royal Kensington. Lindley described the same variety
under several different names, apparently believing them to be distinct. At the first
meeting of the American Pomological Society, in 1848, Grosse Mignonne was placed on
the list of recommended fruits, a place it held until 1899 when it was dropped. Tree large,
moderately vigorous, subject to mildew, productive; glands small, globose; fruit large,
roundish, depressed and marked with a hollow suture at the top, which seems to divide it
into two lobes; color pale greenish-yellow, mottled with red which deepens to brownish-red
on the sunny side; flesh free, pale yellow, rayed with red at the stone, melting, juicy,
with a rich, delicate, vinous flavor; quality good; ripens at the last of August.</p>

peach-sections but inferior quality and small size of fruit condemn it. Several writers

<p>Honey is a Chinese peach probably first raised in Europe from seed sent to the Jardin
des Plantes at Paris, by de Montigny, Consul of France, at Shanghai. The name Honey
may have been applied to it in England. It reproduces itself closely from seed and a
number of slight variations from the original type have been found in America. The
strain chiefly grown in this country was raised by Charles Downing from seed brought
from China. Downing's seedlings failed but prior to their failure he had sent grafts from
them to Henry Lyons, Columbia, South Carolina, who grew some trees. The variety was
probably disseminated in America from this source. In 1889 the American Pomological
Society added Honey to its list of fruits. Tree vigorous, hardy and productive in the
South; glands usually reniform but sometimes globose; fruit small to medium, oblong-oval,
tapering at the apex into a long, sharp nipple or beak, and marked with a distinct suture;
color whitish-yellow, washed and dotted with red, which deepens to almost a crimson
blush; flesh creamy-white, streaked with red around the pit, juicy, very tender, melting,
sweet, with a distinct, rich, honey-like flavor; quality very good; pit free; season in the
South from the middle of June to the first of July.</p>

<p>Lemon Cling dates back to before the Revolutionary War. From all accounts it
originated in South Carolina, probably in Charleston. A number of seminal varieties,
all very similar to Lemon Cling, are cultivated; all of these some writers combine under the
name Lemon Cling. Robert Kennedy introduced the fruit into New York about 1800
where it became known as Kennedy's Carolina or Kennedy's Lemon Clingstone. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
variety is very popular in many sections, especially California, as a canning peach. It
was placed on the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society in 1862. Tree vigorous,
highly productive, bears regularly; leaves crenate, with reniform glands; flowers small,
deep red; fruit large, oval, resembling a lemon; apex terminating in a large nipple; skin
deep yellow, brownish-red where exposed; flesh firm, with a deep, lemon color, red at the
stone, juicy, sprightly, vinous, with an agreeable acidity; very good when perfectly ripe;
stone clings; ripens in September.</p>

<p>This variety, grown by Dr. H. Ray, Yalobusha County, Mississippi, is a seedling
of an old Indian peach. In 1873, it was listed in the American Pomological Society's
fruit-catalog but was dropped in 1897. The variety should not be confused with Ray,
a sort of more recent origin. Glands reniform; fruit of medium size, roundish, with a
shallow suture; apex pointed; skin creamy-white, shaded and spotted with red; flesh
white, juicy, vinous, well-flavored; ripens the last of August.</p>

<p>Red Nutmeg, probably known more than two centuries ago, has little to recommend
it aside from its earliness. Tree moderate in growth, rather dwarf, having large, rose-colored
flowers and leaves with reniform glands; fruit small, roundish, with a distinct suture;
skin pale yellow, with a bright, rich red cheek; flesh yellowish-white, usually red at the
stone which is free, juicy, sweet but with a musky flavor; ripens from the middle to the

<p>This peach has often been confused with Early York and Morris Red Rareripe. The
fruit is larger and broader and ripens a week later than the first and its serrate, glandless
leaves serve to distinguish it from the latter. Because of its similarity to Royal George,
it is supposed to be an American seedling of that variety. Leaves serrate, glandless;
flowers small; fruit large, roundish but broad and depressed; suture broad, extending
nearly around the fruit; skin white, mottled with red dots, with a rich, dark red cheek;
flesh white, red at the stone, juicy, melting, rich, highly flavored; ripens from the middle

<p>Rossanna, though called Alberge by several writers, is a distinct variety. Tree a
medium grower, very productive; flowers small, pale, dull red; leaves crenate; glands
reniform; fruit of medium size, roundish, slightly larger and more flattened than Alberge;
suture prominent; apex terminating in a short nipple; skin yellow, almost entirely overlaid
with deep purple; flesh deep yellow, red at the pit, firm, often mealy, sweet, vinous; stone
small, free; ripens the middle of September.</p>

<p>This peach is distinct from Grosse Mignonne although very similar in most characters.
The chief differences between the two are that this sort has reniform glands and smaller
fruit. The variety was introduced to America from France about 1825 by William Robert
Prince, Flushing, New York.

<p>It is very doubtful if the variety here described as Royal George is the original variety.
According to Hogg the first mention of Royal George is by Switzer who said, in 1724,
that it was raised by a Mr. Oram, Brompton Lane, England. At this time George the
First was on the throne and, no doubt, the peach was named for him. The variety became
popular but was difficult to propagate since it united with peach stocks very poorly.
Hence, nurserymen substituted Millet's Mignonne, a new sort at that time which had
been introduced by a Mr. Millet, North End, Fulham, England. The original Royal
George was probably a seedling of Grosse Mignonne and but little different from that
variety in many characters. The long list of synonyms given Royal George by writers
attests the length of time this name has been extant and the confusion surrounding its
identity. Flowers small; leaves serrate, without glands; fruit large, round, somewhat
depressed, with a moderately deep suture; skin very pale yellowish-white, sprinkled with
many red dots and marbled with deep red; flesh pale yellowish-white, very red at the
stone from which it separates, very juicy, melting, rich and highly flavored; usually ripens
the first of September.</p>

France. It resembles Admirable of which it is a seedling and has been confused more or
less with Belle de Vitry, Bourdine and Teton de Venus, all of which are listed separately
in this text. In 1873 there appeared a Late Admirable in the fruit-list of the American
Pomological Society which is identical with Royale. Leaves crenate, with globose glands;
flowers small, pale red; fruit large, roundish, inclining to oval; suture deep; apex with a
small, pointed nipple; skin pale greenish-yellow, marbled and streaked with dark
red; flesh whitish, stained at the pit, melting, juicy; freestone; ripens at the end of

Cardinale causing much confusion. Sanguine differs from the Sanguinole in ripening earlier
and in having smaller flowers. Glands reniform; flowers of medium size, intensely rose-colored;
fruit large, roundish-oblate, faintly sutured; skin orange-yellow, nearly entirely
overlaid with deep carmine; flesh firm, fibrous, flesh-colored, with deeper streaks of red,

<p>The list of books which follows contains all American pomological
works in which the peach is discussed at any length. Only such European
books are listed, however, as were found useful in writing <i>The Peaches of
New York</i>. Only periodicals are listed to which references are made in
the text of the book. The reports and bulletins of experiment stations
and horticultural societies are not included since the abbreviations used
for such publications will be recognized by all. The date of copyright

M. Cibot, a French missionary, writing nearly a century and a half ago in his memoirs concerning
the Chinese (<b>II</b>:280-293. 1784), gives the following account of peaches with which he was familiar in
China at that time:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peaches are distinguished by size and color, the shape and earliness of their fruit. There are some
whose flesh is white, some greenish, some a delicate yellow, some a yellow orange and some marble; some
are round, some oval, some lengthened to a point like a crow's beak. Peaches are heard of weighing two
pounds or even more. The largest ones I have seen were scarcely three and a half inches in length and
diameter; as to earliness, in the middle provinces there are peaches almost as soon as cherries. It is still
more astonishing that some varieties do not ripen here till October, and that there is a secret by which
they can be kept till January, just as fresh, just as beautiful, and just as delicious as if right off the tree."</p></div>

This early Spanish publication is to be found in the Library of Congress under the title <i>Molina's
Vocubalario en Lengua Castellana y Mexicana</i> (1571). Mr. W. E. Safford, economic botanist in the United
States Department of Agriculture, has been kind enough to translate Molina's reference to the peach.
Mr. Safford writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On page 83a (the pages of Molina are numbered only on one side, and this is the reverse of page 83)
I find as a definition of the fruit of Melocoton (Peach) the following:&mdash;<i>xuchipal durazno</i> (red peach),
<i>cuztic durazno</i> (yellow peach), <i>xocotl melocoton</i> (plum peach). I translate <i>xocotl</i> "plum", because the
Mexicans applied this word to many plum-like fruits, or fruits more or less acid in distinction to <i>tzapotl</i>,
the general term applied to sweet soft fruits. The words cited are all hybrid compounds of Nahuatl and
Spanish. Whatever may be the value of these citations, they establish the fact that the peach was
undoubtedly introduced into Mexico before 1571."</p></div>

<p>Peter Kalm is so often mentioned in the fruit-books published by this Station that readers are entitled
to know something about him. Kalm was a Swede, born in 1715, died in 1779, who was sent by the
Swedish government to travel in North America. He landed in 1748 and spent the next three years in
travel in the settled parts of the New World devoting himself to the study of the plant and animal life,
the natural phenomena, resources and agriculture of the Middle and Northern States and Canada. On
his return to Sweden, Kalm published an account of his travels in America which was afterward translated
into German and then into English. To him we are indebted for much valuable information in
regard to the beginnings of agriculture and horticulture in the middle of the Eighteenth Century in America.
Kalm was a student of Linnaeus and the great botanist perpetuated his memory by naming our beautiful
mountain laurel, <i>Kalmia</i>.</p></div>

Lawson, John <i>History of Carolina</i>, 181-183. 1714. Reprinted at Raleigh, 1860. Lawson's
History of Carolina contains the best description of the natural resources of the southern Atlantic seaboard
published in colonial times. It is a book of nature rather than of history and one of fascinating
interest which cannot be read without admiring and loving the author and mourning his sad fate. Poor
Lawson was burned at the stake by the Indians in 1711. We cannot refrain from quoting his description
of North Carolina as printed on page 79 of his history: "A delicious country, being placed in that girdle
of the world which affords wine, oil, fruit, grain, and silk, with other rich commodities, besides a sweet
air, moderate climate, and fertile soil. These are the blessings, under Heaven's protection, that spin out
the thread of life to its utmost extent, and crown our days with the sweets of health and plenty, which,
when joined with content, render the possessors the happiest race of men upon earth."</p></div>

David Thomas is now scarcely known in horticulture except as he is spoken of as the father of
America's well-known agricultural, horticultural and pomological writer, John Jacob Thomas. Yet the
father merits recognition for his work in agriculture and horticulture. David Thomas was a Quaker,
born in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in 1776. He became a civil engineer and moved to Aurora,
Cayuga County, New York, in 1805 and began to practice his profession. Later he became one of the
engineers in charge of the construction of the Erie Canal and still later performed a similar service in
building the Welland Canal. Soon after, we find him a nurseryman and fruit-grower at Aurora. Throughout
his entire life, his son writes, he was interested in horticulture, pomology and botany and by his writings
on these subjects, published principally in the <i>Genesee Farmer</i>, then the leading agricultural paper
in western New York, and in <i>Travels in the Western Country in 1816</i>, published in Auburn in 1819, David
Thomas performed most valuable services in forwarding the cultivation of fruits. He was a corresponding
member of the London Horticultural Society and of the Linnaean Society of Paris. His articles in the
<i>Genesee Farmer</i> and other agricultural papers furnish the most authoritative statements we have in regard
to the early history of fruit-growing in western New York. The name of David Thomas ought long to
be preserved by horticulturists of the State and country together with that of his illustrious son, John
Jacob Thomas.</p></div>

John Kenrick, one of the pioneer nurserymen on American soil, began his business career by raising
peach-seedlings. His nursery was situated in the towns of Newton and Brighton, Massachusetts, and
was founded in 1790. As we have stated in the text, he early acquired the art of budding and possibly
was the first, or at least one of the first, nurserymen to offer budded peach-trees for sale. In 1823, he
advertised in the <i>New England Farmer</i> thirty varieties of budded peaches five to eight feet high at thirty-three
and one-third cents each. These thirty varieties must have included practically all of the named
sorts then grown in America. It is interesting to note that he states in the advertisement that the trees
were packed with clay and mats. It was in this year that William Kenrick, son of John Kenrick, became
a partner of his father. Beside growing peaches, the Kenrick nurseries offered for sale other trees, vine
and bush-fruits and ornamentals as well. The Kenricks were also extensive growers of currants from which
they made currant-wine, their output in 1824 being 1700 gallons; in 1825, 3000 gallons and in 1826, 3600
gallons. The date and place of John Kenrick's birth cannot be learned. His death occurred in 1833 in
the Kenrick mansion, built in 1720, standing near the nurseries. New England, and peach-growers
everywhere, owe him a debt of gratitude for his services in horticulture.</p></div>

William Kenrick, son of John, of whom we have just written, was born in 1795 in the family mansion
on Nonantum Hill in the town of Newton, Massachusetts. He was trained by his father as a nurseryman
and in 1823 became a partner in the Kenrick nurseries, of which he soon after appears to have assumed
control. The Kenrick nurseries, at this time, were probably the most extensive and the best known of
any in New England. Besides growing the fruit-bearing plants of the time and such ornamentals as were
then to be found in America, the Kenricks seem to have taken an enthusiastic part in the craze for the
Lombardy Poplar which was then raging in America. The elder Kenrick must have been one of the early
growers of this popular plant for in 1797 two acres of his nursery was appropriated to the Lombardy Poplar.
The son, in his turn an enthusiast, succumbed to the silk-culture fad and seems in 1835 to have been one
of the leading growers of the mulberry, <i>Morus multicaulus</i> for feeding silkworms. In this year Mr. Kenrick
published the <i>American Silk Growers Guide</i>, which is, in essence, a treatise on mulberry-culture.
William Kenrick's most notable pomological achievement, however, was the publication of the <i>New
American Orchardist</i> which appeared in 1833. While not the best of the pomological manuals of the time,
it is a valuable contribution to American pomology because of its full descriptions of the fruits of that date.
Beginning with his father in 1823, William Kenrick continued in the nursery business for twenty-seven
years, probably growing, importing and disposing of more fruit and ornamental trees than any other
nurseryman in New England during this time. He died in February, 1872, at the ripe age of 77, having
lived to see the orchards planted from his nursery come to full fruition and every part of New England
made more beautiful by the ornamental trees and shrubs grown under his care.</p></div>

Parkinson <i>Par. Ter.</i> 582, 583. 1629.</p>

<p>"I presume that the name <i>Nucipersica</i> doth most rightly belong unto that kinde of Peach, which
we call Nectorins, and although they have beene with us not many yeares, yet have they beene knowne
both in Italy to Matthiolus, and others before him, who it seemeth knew no other then the yellow Nectorin,
as Dalechampius also: But we at this day doe know five severall sorts of Nectorins, as they shall be
presently set downe; and as in the former fruits, so in this, I will give you the description of one, and
briefe notes of the rest.</p>

<p>The Nectorin is a tree of no great bignesse, most usually lesser then the Peach tree, his body and
elder boughes being whitish, the younger branches very red, whereon grow narrow long greene leaves, so
like unto Peach leaves, that none can well distinguish them, unlesse it be in this, that they are somewhat
lesser: the blossomes are all reddish, as the Peach, but one of a differing fashion from all the other, as I
shall shew you by and by: the fruit that followeth is smaller, rounder, and smoother than Peaches, without
any cleft on the side, and without any douny cotton or freeze at all; and herein is like unto the outer
greene rinde of the Wallnut, whereof as I am perswaded it tooke the name, of a fast and firme meate, and
very delicate in taste, especially the best kindes, with a rugged stone within it, and a bitter kernell.</p>

<p>The Muske Nectorin, so called, because it being a kinde of the best red Nectorins, both smelleth
and eateth as if the fruit were steeped in Muske: some thinke that this and the next Romane Nectorin
are all one.</p>

<p>The Romane red Nectorin, or cluster Nectorin, hath a large or great purplish blossome, like unto
a Peach, reddish at the bottome on the outside, and greenish within: the fruit is of a fine red colour on the
outside, and groweth in clusters, two or three at a joynt together, of an excellent good taste.</p>

<p>The bastard red Nectorin hath a smaller or pincking blossome, more like threads then leaves, neither
so large nor open as the former, and yellowish within at the bottome: the fruit is red on the outside, and
groweth never but one at a joynt; it is a good fruit, but eateth a little more rawish then the other, even
when it is full ripe.</p>

<p>The yellow Nectorin is of two sorts, the one an excellent fruit, mellow, and of a very good rellish;
the other hard, and no way comparable to it.</p>

<p>The greene Nectorin, great and small; for such I have seene abiding constant, although both planted
in one ground: they are both of one goodnesse, and accounted with most to be the best rellished Nectorin
of all others.</p>

<p>The white Nectorin is said to bee differing from the other, in that it will bee more white on the outside
when it is ripe, then either the yellow or greene: but I have not yet seene it.</p>

<p class="center">The Use of Nectorins.</p>

<p>The fruit is more firme then the Peach, and more delectable in taste; and is therefore of more
esteeme, and that worthily."</p></div>

Prince, Wm. <i>Treat. on Hort.</i> 16. 1828.</p>

<p>William Prince, second of the name in American pomology and third proprietor of the celebrated
Prince nurseries at Flushing, Long Island, was born November 10, 1766, and died April 9, 1842. His
grandfather, a French Huguenot, was the founder of the establishment of which he became owner, and
in which he made his reputation. Under his father, the first William Prince, the nursery at Flushing
developed into a great commercial nursery, a private experiment station, a testing ground for American
and foreign fruits and a botanic garden of American plants. The mantle dropped by William Prince,
the father, at his death in 1802, fell upon the shoulders of William Prince, subject of this sketch, then just
reaching the prime of life and one of the most brilliant and versatile pomologists the country has known.
William Prince continued most successfully the work of his father in breeding new varieties, domesticating
native plants and importing foreign fruits and ornamentals. During his supervision the Prince Nursery
reached the height of its fame. It was conducted less for money than for love of the work. An attempt
was made to grow every American and European plant-species having horticultural value. The catalogs
published from the nursery by William Prince are among the best horticultural and botanical contributions
of the first half of the Nineteenth Century. Besides these, William Prince is the author of the
<i>Treatise on Horticulture</i>, published in 1828, and gave assistance to his son, William Robert Prince, in preparing
his <i>Pomological Manual</i> published in 1832. In the description of varieties in this text it will be
found that many varieties of peaches were originated, introduced, imported or first described by William
Prince.</p></div>

Wickson <i>Cal. Fruits</i> 450-456. 1914.</p>

<p>"<i>Trays for Drying.</i>&mdash;The fruit is placed upon trays for exposure to the sun. There is great variation
in the size of the trays. The common small tray is made of one-half inch sugar-pine lumber two feet
wide and three feet long, the boards forming it being held together by nailing to a cleat on each end, one
by one and a quarter inches, and a lath or narrow piece of half-inch stuff is nailed over the ends of the
boards, thus stiffening the tray and aiding to prevent warping.</p>

<p>A large tray which is used by some growers is four feet square, and is made of slats three-eighths of
an inch thick, and one and a half inches wide, the slats being nailed to three cross slats three-eighths of
an inch thick and three inches wide, and the ends nailed to a narrow strip one-half inch thick by three-quarters
of an inch wide on the other side.</p>

<p>Since large drying yards have been supplied with tramways and trucks for moving the fruit instead
of hand carriage, larger trays, three feet by six or three feet by eight, have been largely employed. These
tramways lead from the cutting sheds to the sulphur boxes and thence to various parts of the large drying
grounds, making it possible to handle large amounts of fruit at a minimum cost.</p>

<p><i>Protecting Fruit from Dew.</i>&mdash;In the interior there are seldom any deposit of dew in the drying season
but occasionally there are early rains before the drying season is over. The fruit is then protected by
piling the trays one upon another, in which operation the thick cleats serve a good purpose. In dewy
regions the trays are piled at night, or cloth or paper is sometimes stretched over the fruit, thus reducing
the discoloration resulting from deposits of moisture upon it.</p>

<p><i>Drying Floors.</i>&mdash;For the most part the trays are laid directly on the ground, but sometimes a staging
of posts and rails is built to support them, about twenty inches from the ground. The drying trays are
sometimes distributed through the orchard or vineyard, thus drying the fruit with as little carrying as
possible. Others clear off a large space outside the plantation and spread the trays where full sunshine
can be obtained. Drying spaces should be selected at a distance from traveled roads, to prevent the
deposit of dust on the fruit * * *.</p>

<p><i>Grading.</i>&mdash;It is of great advantage in drying to have all the fruit on a tray of approximately the same
size, and grading before cutting is advisable. Machines are now made which accomplish this very cheaply
and quickly.</p>

<p><i>Cutting-Sheds.</i>&mdash;Shelter of some kind is always provided for the fruit-cutters. Sometimes it is only
a temporary bower made of poles and beams upon which tree branches are spread as a thatch; sometimes
open-side sheds with boarded roof, and sometimes a finished fruit-house is built, two stories high, the
lower story opening with large doors on the north side, and with a large loft above, where the dried fruit
can be sweated, packed, and stored for sale. The climate is such that almost any shelter which suits the
taste of the purse of the producer will answer the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Sulphuring.</i>&mdash;The regulations promulgated under the pure food law enacted by Congress in 1906
established an arbitrary limit to the percentage of sulphur compounds in evaporated fruits, which was
shown by producers to be destructive to their industry, and otherwise unwarranted and unreasonable.
As a result of their protest the enforcement of such regulations was indefinitely postponed, pending the
results of scientific investigation which began in 1898.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the California producer it must be held that before the employment of the
sulphur process, California cured fruits were suitable only to the lowest culinary uses. They were of
undesirable color, devoid of natural flavor, offensive by content of insect life. They had no value which
would induce production and discernible future. Placing the trays of freshly cut fruit in boxes or small
'houses,' with the fumes of burning sulphur, made it possible to preserve its natural color and flavor
during the evaporation of its surplus moisture in the clear sunshine and dry air of the California summer.
It also prevented souring, which with some fruits is otherwise not preventable in such open air drying,
and it protected the fruit from insect attack during the drying process. By the use of sulphur and by
no other agency has it been possible to lift the production of cured fruits of certain kinds from a low-value
haphazard by-product to a primary product for which Californians have planted orchards, constructed
packing houses and made a name in the world's markets.</p>

<p>The action of sulphuring is not alone to protect the fruit, it facilitates evaporation so that about one-half
less time is required therefor. Not the least important bearing of this fact is the feasibility of curing
fruits in larger pieces. The grand half-peaches, half-apricots, half-pears of the California cured fruits
are the direct result of the sulphur process. Without it the fruit must be cut into small sections or ribbons,
which in cooking break down into an uninviting mass, while, with the sulphuring, it is ordinary practice
to produce the splendid halves with their natural color so preserved that they lie in cut glass dishes in
suggestive semblance to the finest product of the canners, and are secured at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>There are various contrivances for the application of sulphur fumes to the freshly-cut fruit. Some
are small for hand carriage of trays; some are large and the trays are wheeled into them upon trucks. The
most common is a bottomless cabinet about five or six feet high, of a width equal to the length of the tray
and a depth a little more than the width of the tray. The cabinet has a door the whole width of one side,
and on the sides within cleats are nailed so that the trays of fruit slip in like drawers into a bureau. Some
push in the trays so that the bottom one leaves a little space at the back, the next a little space at the
front, and so on, that the fumes may be forced by the draft to pass between the trays back and forward.
The essentials seem to be open holes or dampers in the bottom and top of the cabinet so that the fumes
from the sulphur burning at the bottom may be thoroughly distributed through the interior, and then all
openings are tightly closed. To secure a tight chamber the door has its edge felted and the cabinet is
made of matched lumber. The sulphur is usually put on a shovel or iron pot, and it is ignited by a hot
coal, or a hot iron, or it is thrown on paper of which the edges are set on fire, or a little alcohol is put on
the sulphur and lighted, etc. The sulphur is usually burned in a pit in the ground under the cabinet.
The application of sulphur must be watchfully and carefully made, and the exposure of the fruit should
only be long enough to accomplish the end desired. The exposure required differs for different fruits,
and with the same fruits in different conditions, and must be learned by experience.</p>

<p><i>Grading and Cleaning.</i>&mdash;After the fruit is sufficiently dried (and it is impossible to describe how this
point may be recognized except by the experienced touch), it is gathered from the trays in to large boxes
and taken to the fruit house. Some growers put it into a revolving drum of punctured sheet iron, which
rubs the pieces together and separates it from dust, etc., which falls out through the apertures as the drum
revolves. Others empty the fruit upon a large wire-cloth table and pick it over, grading it according to
size and color, and at the same time the dust and small particles of foreign matter fall through the wire
cloth. The fanning mill for cleaning grain may also be used for rapid separation of dirt, leaves, etc., with
proper arrangement of metal screens.</p>

<p><i>Sweating.</i>&mdash;All fruit, if stored in mass after drying, becomes moist. This action should take place
before packing. To facilitate it, the fruit is put in piles on the floor of the fruit house and turned occasionally
with a scoop shovel; or, if allowed to sweat in boxes, the fruit is occasionally poured from one box
to another. The sweating equalizes the moisture throughout the mass. Some large producers have
sweat-rooms with tight walls, which preserve an even temperature. No fruit should be packed before
'going through the sweat.' If this is not done, discoloration and injury will result.</p>

<p><i>Dipping before Packing.</i>&mdash;All fruits except prunes can be packed in good condition without dipping,
provided the fruit is not over-dried. Efforts should be made to take up the fruit when it is just sufficiently
cured to prevent subsequent fermentation. If taken from the trays in the heat of the day and covered
so that the fruit moth can not reach it there is little danger of worms. The highest grades of fruit are made
in this way. If, however, the fruit has been over-dried or neglected, it can be dipped in boiling water to
kill eggs of vermin and to make the fruit a little more pliable for the press. The dipping should be done
quickly, and the fruit allowed to drain and then lie in a dark room, carefully covered, for twenty-four
hours before packing.</p>

<p><i>Packing.</i>&mdash;To open well, packages of dried fruit should be 'faced.' The many fine arts of paper
lining, etc., must be learned by observation. Flatten some fair specimens of the fruit to be packed (and
reference is especially made to such fruits as apricots, peaches and nectarines) by running them through
a clothes wringer or similar pair of rollers set to flatten but not crush the fruit. Do not face with better
fruit than the package is to contain. It is a fraud which will not in the end be profitable. Lay the flattened
fruit (cup side down) neatly in the bottom of the box. Fill the box until it reaches the amount the box
is to contain, and then apply the press until the bottom can be nailed on. Invert the box and put on the
label or brand; the bottom then becomes the top.</p>

<p>Many different kinds of boxes are used. A very good size is made of seasoned pine, six inches deep
by nine inches wide by fifteen inches long, inside measurements, and it will hold twenty-five pounds of
fruit. * * *</p>

<p><i>Peaches.</i>&mdash;Take the fruit when it is fully ripe, but not mushy; cut cleanly all around to extract the
pit and put on trays cup side up; get into the sulphur box as soon as possible after cutting. Peaches are
dried both peeled and unpeeled, but drying without peeling is chiefly done. Peeling is done with the
small paring machines or with a knife. Peeling with lye has been generally abandoned because of discoloration
of the fruit after packing, although it can be successfully done by frequently changing the lye
and using ample quantities of fresh water for rinsing after dipping.</p>

<p>Clingstone peaches are successfully handled with curved knives and spoon-shaped pitters in conjunction
with ordinary fruit knives. Different styles are carried at the general stores in the fruit districts,
and individuals differ widely in their preferences.</p>

<p>The weight of dried peaches which can be obtained from a certain weight of fresh fruit, depends
upon the variety; some varieties yield at least a third more than others, and clings yield more than freestones
as a rule. Dry-fleshed peaches, like the Muir, yield one pound dry from four or five pounds fresh,
while other more juicy fruits may require six or seven pounds.</p>

<p><i>Nectarines.</i>&mdash;Nectarines are handled like peaches; the production of translucent amber fruit in
the sun depends upon the skillful use of sulphur."</p></div>

<i>Fruit Trees</i>, published in 1817 by William Coxe, is the first American pomology. Though written
by an amateur, during most of his life a merchant, his work was done with so much care and exhibits such
nice discrimination in selecting, describing and discussing varieties of fruits that until the later and more
complete work of Andrew Jackson Downing and Charles Downing, Coxe's <i>Fruit Trees</i>, competing with
several other manuals, was the standard pomological work of America. William Coxe was born in
Philadelphia, May 3, 1762, and died near Burlington, New Jersey, February 25, 1831. He seems to have
inherited wealth and with it scholarly habits and such refinement and charm of personality that in Philadelphia
and later in Burlington, to which place he removed in early manhood, he was one of the leaders
in literary, scientific and social circles. His tastes early led him to the cultivation of fruit and he began to
grow the varieties then to be had in America and to import sorts from England and France so that by
1817 he was able to say that he had been "for many years actively engaged in the rearing, planting and
cultivating fruit trees on a scale more extensive than has been attempted by any other individual in this
country." Previous to this for some years, how long cannot be said, he was the moneyed partner with
one Daniel Smith in what, for the times, was an extensive fruit-tree and ornamental nursery. Demands
for information became so frequent that he determined to put his knowledge in print and his <i>Fruit Trees</i>
was the result. The objects he sought to obtain in writing are well set forth in the title page as follows:
"A VIEW of the CULTIVATION of FRUIT TREES, and the Management of Orchards and Cider;
with Accurate Descriptions of the Most Estimable Varieties of NATIVE AND FOREIGN APPLES,
PEARS, PEACHES, PLUMS, AND CHERRIES, Cultivated in the Middle States of America; Illustrated
by Cuts of two hundred kinds of Fruits of the natural size; Intended to Explain Some of the errors which
exist relative to the origin, popular names, and character of many of our fruits; to identify them by accurate
descriptions of their properties, and correct delineations of the full size and natural formation of each
variety; and to exhibit a system of practice adapted to our climate, in the Successive Stages of
A NURSERY, ORCHARD, AND CIDER ESTABLISHMENT." He was at one time a member of
the State Legislature and later a Congressman intimately associated with Daniel Webster. He was, also,
an honorary member of the Horticultural Society of London to which during many years he was a faithful
correspondent. It was Coxe's privilege to see the very beginnings of commercial peach-growing in America
and through his nursery, his orchard and his book he contributed much to American peach-culture.</p></div>

Theodatus Timothy Lyon, fruit-grower, experimenter and writer, was for many years the leading
pomological authority of his adopted State, Michigan. T. T. Lyon, as he always signed his name, was
born in Lima, New York, January 13, 1813, and died in South Haven, Michigan, February 6, 1900. At
the age of fifteen he moved with his parents to Michigan where until his thirty-first year, in 1844, he
worked at most of the arts and crafts practiced by pioneers in a new country. In the year named, he
began the career of horticulturist, by planting a nursery at Plymouth, Michigan. In the nearby regions
French missionaries had early planted orchards and old settlers had long been importing varieties of fruit.
The nomenclature of these fruits was in uttermost confusion. T. T. Lyon set himself the task of ascertaining
the correct names of these varieties in the old settlements of the State. The result was he became
the pomological authority of the State. In 1874 Mr. Lyon moved to the famous "<i>peach-belt</i>" of western
Michigan, where he lived until his death. Here, at first, he was president of a prominent nursery company.
In 1876 he was elected president of the State Horticultural Society and continued as its active president
until 1891 and from then on until his death was honorary president. In 1888 T. T. Lyon wrote a <i>History
of Michigan Horticulture</i> which was published in the Seventeenth Report of the State Horticultural Society.
From the beginning of his interests in horticulture in southwestern Michigan Mr. Lyon was particularly
interested in peaches&mdash;growing seedlings, testing new varieties, planting orchards and in every way
helping to forward the great peach-industry of the region. He was probably, in his time, the best informed,
the most accurate and the most critical judge of peaches in this country. In 1889 he was given charge
of the South Haven Sub-station of the Michigan Experiment Station which gave him added facilities
for studying and describing fruits and a means of publishing, through his connection with the Experiment
Station, bulletins on fruits. These, for accuracy of description of varieties, are still unsurpassed among
American pomological publications. Besides these bulletins, the fruit-lists in the reports of the Michigan
Horticultural Society and in the American Pomological Society, during the last half of the Nineteenth
Century, show the results of his accurate judgment of fruits. A modest man, shrinking from publicity,
his printed works but poorly represent his vast knowledge of fruits and his great influence in the betterment
of American pomology.</p></div>
